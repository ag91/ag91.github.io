      <title>Emacs as your code-compass: who is the person who refactored most in this project?</title>

<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: who is the person who refactored most in this project?</h1>
<p>
It is a while I don't post about <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>. I recently jumped back
in the consulting world and it is a hectic life! In a couple of months
I moved from a project to another. Furthermore, I cannot say I got
somebody introducing me to the software architecture of these projects
(or even their status).
</p>

<p>
Lucky me these years (from Ph.D. to industry times) have given me some
experience, so my boat is well equipped for this wavy sea. Also I have
a great tool: in both projects I just had to rely on my Emacs for a
reliable code-compass.
</p>

<p>
So armed of hotspots, knowledge and communication graphs with a bit of
churn, fragmentation and <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/27/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-complex-is-this-code/">complexity</a> on the side, I could get up and
running faster than ever! Yay!!
</p>

<p>
One thing I have been missing is to explore graphically who dedicated
themselves to the lovely art of refactoring. Indeed, the project on
which I rely, the fantastic code-maat, offers a refactoring analysis.
This finds who has <span class="underline">deleted</span> most lines in a file using Git commits
information.
</p>

<p>
Naturally deletions are an approximation for refactoring, but good
enough as less code is always an improvement (at least for our eyes).
</p>

<p>
Well there I go: I added it just now. It was pretty easy because is
super-similar to the knowledge graph implementation. So a tweak here
and there and it is now available.
</p>

<p>
Below a video that gives you a sense of what it is about.

</p>

<p>
If you want to try that yourself it is easy: just try out <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> ;)
</p>

<p>
Happy refactoring!
