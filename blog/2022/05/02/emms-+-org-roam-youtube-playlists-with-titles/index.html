<h1>Emms + Org Roam: YouTube playlists with titles!</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org477f07d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org477f07d">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org477f07d">
<p>
I extend Emms to parse EXTM3U playlists of youtube links so I can
listen to songs with MPV and read their titles!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org701015c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org701015c">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org701015c">
<p>
I like music. And lucky me YouTube is a treasure chest of songs! I
already wrote how I made <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/01/25/vlc-via-emacs-how-to-open-a-youtube-link/">VLC become my YouTube music player</a>. Well
somehow that stopped working: YouTube API changes often enough to
break VLC plugins. Also what a pity I wasn't using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/">GNU Emms</a>! That is a
great mode for playing a song with a few keybindings.
</p>

<p>
I got also used to capture music I like as Org Roam notes: I <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2017/01/29/how-to-fit-rss-feeds-into-an-org-file/">use
Org-Feed</a> with a Reddit RSS that sends me some random music that
redditors like, and <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/11/12/write-org-roam-notes-via-elisp/">I extract Org Roam notes</a> for those songs I like.
</p>

<p>
Now I have musical notes that can make a playlist: how to get them
played?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4324a08" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4324a08">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4324a08">
<p>
Emms + Mpv + youtube-dl is the answer :) At least part of it. Let me
explain.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/">Youtube-dl</a> is a software that lets you download YouTube videos. Since
that is its core feature, it should not fail when the API changes.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv">Mpv</a> is a free media player and leverages youtube-dl to play YouTube
links: it downloads them in a temporary directory and plays them while
youtube-dl is downloading (i.e., streaming).
</p>

<p>
Emms supports Mpv by default. So after you install these dependencies
you are already at a good point.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to produce a list of your links and feed them to Mpv.
Mpv accepts playlist files in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">M3U format</a>. This is basically a list
of files or urls in a text file.
</p>

<p>
With that you can run <code>mpv your-playlist.m3u</code> and it will start
playing. Before we move on the next issue, let's plugin Emms. If you
run <code>emms-play-m3u-playlist</code> giving that file, the music will play.
BUT also the video! In my case that wasn't necessary: I want to listen
to songs and not watch their videos. You can fix that by setting some
Emms variables. Here my Emms config code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(emms-all)
(emms-default-players)
(setq-default
   emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music/"

   emms-source-playlist-default-format 'm3u
   emms-playlist-mode-center-when-go t
   emms-playlist-default-major-mode 'emms-playlist-mode
   emms-show-format "NP: %s"

   emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpv)
   emms-player-mpv-environment '("PULSE_PROP_media.role=music")
   emms-player-mpv-parameters '("--quiet" "--really-quiet" "--no-video" "--no-audio-display" "--force-window=no" "--vo=null"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The relevant bit is <code>'("--quiet" "--really-quiet" "--no-video"
"--no-audio-display" "--force-window=no" "--vo=null")</code>, which is
telling to avoid displaying Mpv window AND to skip the video.
</p>

<p>
This is probably something you don't want to set if you also watch
videos with Mpv from Emms, but that is not my case.
</p>

<p>
Now to the fun part: how do you create the playlist? Well Org Roam API
to the rescue: since I backlink songs to a common note, I just need to
gather these notes with some Elisp and print their links in a M3U
file.
</p>

<p>
When you open a playlist of YouTube urls (the M3U file), you will
discover that running <code>emms-playlist-mode-go</code> will show just a list of
links. If you want to know the title of this song, or if you want to
listen to a particular song, you have to memorize YouTube links. I am
not good at that.
</p>

<p>
So with a bit of browsing, I discovered that there is a fancier way to
define a playlist: an EXTM3U format (I guess EXT is for extended).
This allows to provide the title and length of the song along to its
file or link.
</p>

<p>
Naturally... Emms doesn't support the extended format. At least a code
comment tells that is not implemented yet. Well I need it, so I will
implement it. (If an Emms developer reads this: please feel free to
"get inspired" by my code ;)
</p>

<p>
This also gives me a chance to show-off how nicely the Emms developers
made it for contributors to add their own new playlist parser. The
idea is that you need 3 things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a way to find out if the file you open is indeed a playlist,</li>
<li>a way to extract the songs and make emms "tracks" out of them</li>
<li>a way to convert emms tracks back into the playlist file format</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the following I cover 1 and 2, and I ignore 3 (because I keep the
playlist links as Org Roam notes, which is more powerful than a text
file).
</p>

<p>
How do we recognize an EXTM3U file? Simple! It has to start with a
header: #EXTM3U.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emms-source-playlist-extm3u-p ()
    "Return non-nil if the current buffer contains an extm3u playlist."
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (s-contains? "#EXTM3U" (buffer-string))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That was easy! Next, parse the playlist with names. Let's peek into
how Emms parses m3u playlists first:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emms-source-playlist-parse-m3u (playlist-file)
  "Parse the m3u playlist in the current buffer.
Files will be relative to the directory of PLAYLIST-FILE, unless
they have absolute paths."
  (let ((dir (file-name-directory playlist-file)))
    (mapcar (lambda (file)
              (if (string-match "\\`\\(http[s]?\\|mms\\)://" file)
                  (emms-track 'url file)
                (emms-track 'file (expand-file-name file dir))))
            (emms-source-playlist-m3u-files))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This gathers links in the EXTM3U file with
<code>emms-source-playlist-m3u-files</code> and then for each, if it is a link
creates a URL <code>emms-track</code>, otherwise a filepath one.
</p>

<p>
Cool, let's start from gathering urls and titles for our extm3u counterpart:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emms-source-playlist-extm3u-files-names ()
    "Extract a list of filenames from the given extm3u playlist.

Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored."
    (--keep
     (and (not (s-starts-with-p "#" it))
          (--&gt; it
               (s-split "\n" it t)
               (list :name (nth 1 (s-split "," (nth 0 it) t)) :file (nth 1 it))))
     (s-split "#EXTINF:" (buffer-string))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I am using <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a> here because I like that style of coding. In short
it
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
splits the file contents on "#EXTINF:"
</p>

<p>
that header identifies the start of a song definition, so splitting
will create N+1 entries each containing the song info
</p>

<p>
We ignore the first that contains the main header of the file
(i.e., <code>#EXTM3U</code>)
</p></li>

<li>ignores the entry's header and extract name and file from each entry
I found before as a plist <code>(:name :file)</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now we can feed that in our main parsing function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emms-source-playlist-parse-extm3u (playlist-file)
  "Parse the m3u playlist in the current buffer.
Files will be relative to the directory of PLAYLIST-FILE, unless
they have absolute paths."
  (let ((dir (file-name-directory playlist-file)))
    (mapcar (lambda (name-file)
              (let* ((file (plist-get name-file :file))
                     (track (if (string-match "\\`\\(http[s]?\\|mms\\)://" file)
                                (emms-track 'url file)
                              (emms-track 'file (expand-file-name file dir))))
                     (_ (emms-track-set track 'info-title (plist-get name-file :name))))
                track))
            (emms-source-playlist-extm3u-files-names))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The only change here from the Emms' <code>m3u</code> function is that we set the
title for the track with <code>(emms-track-set track 'info-title (plist-get
name-file :name))</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now if you load these functions and open an EXTM3U playlist, Emms will
open it AND display the title as well. I typically store music notes
in a format "AUTHOR -- TITLE", so I didn't bother to set the author
information for the track (yet). Hopefully Emms provides a track
property for that as well :)
</p>

<p>
That's it! Now I can listen to music with Emms, know what I am playing
AND finally be able to choose the song I like. All of this keeping my
hard-drive empty.

If you didn't think you could listen/manage music from YouTube within
Emacs think again :D Also Emms developers are awesome!

Happy listening!
