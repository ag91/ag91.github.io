<h1>Self reflection: a favour I own myself (with a bit of org-ql to make it easier!)</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org9f93a9b" class="outline-2">

Periodic self reflection is a way to become a better person. I use
org-ql to help me pick what activity I can self reflect upon.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf3da45c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf3da45c">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf3da45c">
<p>
Sometimes ago I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43324966-no-more-feedback?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=6u39Ftmr6b&amp;rank=1">"No More Feedback" by Carol Sanford</a>. The author's
point about self reflection has inspired me since: rather than tell
others what they are doing wrong or they could better, facilitate
their self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
Self reflecting is thinking about a past action/behavior and see how
to make it better. This is better because the person reflecting can
come up with their own best solution (which definitely isn't yours:
innovation!).
</p>

<p>
Well, before applying this on others I wanted to start facilitating
self-reflection for myself.
</p>

<p>
I tend to do a lot of things and that busyness rarely let me self
reflect.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org550757b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org550757b">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org550757b">
<p>
Well I guess the issue is everywhere really: from school's exams to
work performance reviews, you can always find somebody telling how you
can be better. As Carol points out in her book, this form of input
constrains you in the expectations of others which most of the time is
not good for you on the long term. For instance, say I have a family
member that leaves in a city without hospital: I could tell them they
would be better off by moving to one that has it because I needed an
hospital in the past. That may make sense for <b>my</b> situation, while
they could never want/need to use a hospital in their life for
whatever reason. If they were to follow my suggestion without
understanding/sharing my context, they would move without
understanding why and possibly become less happy in the process. That
usually creates even bigger issues.
</p>

<p>
And a lot of time following orders without understanding the deepest
reasons (and so outsourcing responsibilities) cause major disasters
for the many.
</p>

<p>
Maybe self reflecting on what we did (and plan to do) can also give us
more control of our lives. And if others copy us, well everybody will
be better off (and they will be far more interesting people to share
our time with).

<div id="outline-container-org79e4685" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org79e4685">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org79e4685">
<p>
I spend a lot of time working in Emacs, so I thought my favourite
editor could nudge me to self reflect.
</p>

<p>
My first iteration has been to add a habit to my agenda that reminds
me to reflect every 3 days.
</p>

<p>
I install org-habit like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(use-package org-habit
  :ensure nil
  :defer 9
  :config
  ;; enable org-habit tracking
  (add-to-list 'org-modules 'org-habit))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and my habit for self reflection looks like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">* TODO self reflect]: pick a task/decision/action of this week and note down an improvement
SCHEDULED: &lt;2022-10-02 Sun .+1d/3d&gt;
:PROPERTIES:
:STYLE: habit
:REPEAT_TO_STATE: TODO
:END:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After a few reflections, I thought one thing that I could possibly
tackle is tasks that I postpone all the times. So I came up with an
<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql">org-ql</a> query that orders my completed tasks for last week by the time
they waited for my action:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun my/org-delta-scheduled-created (headline)
  (or (ignore-errors (--&gt; headline
                          (nth 1 it)
                          (ts-diff
                           (ts-parse (--&gt; (plist-get it :closed)
                                          (nth 1 it)
                                          (plist-get it :raw-value)
                                          (s-split "\\[" it)
                                          (nth 1 it)
                                          (s-split " " it)
                                          car))
                           (ts-parse (--&gt; (plist-get it :CREATED)
                                          (s-split "\\[" it)
                                          (nth 1 it)
                                          (s-split " " it)
                                          car)))))
      0))

(--&gt; (org-ql-query
       :from (org-agenda-files)
       :where
       `(and (done)
             (not (habit))
             (scheduled :from ,(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-read-date nil t "-1w")))))
     (--sort
      (&gt; (my/org-delta-scheduled-created it) (my/org-delta-scheduled-created other))
      it)
     (--map
      `(,(--&gt; it
              (nth 1 it)
              (plist-get it :raw-value))
        ,(/ (my/org-delta-scheduled-created it) 60 60 24))
      it)
     (cons '(done-task days-needed) (cons 'hline it))
     )
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This relies on me adding a :CREATED property every time I capture a
task and a :CLOSED property when I complete it. The code above
calculates the difference between these times in days and sorts the
entries.
</p>

<p>
So if I have no idea what to self reflect on, I can run this code
block and see some tasks that I have delayed for many days and think
what went wrong there. Of course, there may be something more
important to reflect upon, but this is just to help myself.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2296e5b">
<p>
This is what I am trying lately to improve myself! A bit of self
reflecting on my busy life by adding an habit in my agenda and sorting
the last week tasks by latency.
</p>

<p>
Hope you will have time to try (more) self reflection too.
</p>

<p>
Happy self-reflecting!
