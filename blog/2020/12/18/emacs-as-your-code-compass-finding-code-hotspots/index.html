<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: finding code hotspots</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org338b5f2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org338b5f2">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org338b5f2">
<p>
Hotspots are the best tool to observe your code technical debt and
smell modules that may contain bugs. In this post I show you how to
use code-compass to make this analysis and explain how to interpret
the analysis.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org96d5aae" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org96d5aae">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96d5aae">
<p>
Say you start your software project. You organize your code in a
elegant and simple way, and the product is successful. So successful
that you cannot handle it by yourself. Now you hire some fellow
developers. You take care of checking all their code to fit your
standard. The product is even more successful: you hire more
colleagues. Now you cannot check the code anymore and you must trust
who you carefully hired. Your input would be much valuable when things
go wrong, but at this point you may not be aware of it: lack of
visibility!
</p>

<p>
Often you are the one joining and nobody has a complete
understanding of the original structure of the code and the reasons
things were done that way. Since change is unavoidable (that is the
reason why you hire/are hired), well... you start changing the code
anyway.
</p>

<p>
According to how you change an artifact, you make it easier or more
difficult to change it further. Making it easier typically takes extra
mental resources and effort.
</p>

<p>
Good engineers go for the sustainable option and also try to reduce
any existing complexity whey they encounter it.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion that is a bit reactive and late. Ideally I would like to
monitor via a high level and always updated view if the code is
growing badly. In that way I can plan and prioritize my maintenance.
Furthermore I would like to use the same analysis to evaluate my own
work, and so make sure I do not make my code more complex with my
changes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe60886" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbe60886">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbe60886">
<p>
Software complexity relates to quantity of code and frequency of
change. This means that if I keep frequently adding code to the same
module, I am making it more difficult for a future reader to
understand what it does. And if a reader struggles to understand what
a module does, the reader also missed to find functional problems with
my code.
</p>

<p>
A continuous extension of the same module may also show that I am
giving too many responsibilities to it.
</p>

<p>
If I am not just extending it but rather modifying existing behavior,
then it is also likely I am adding errors in the flow.
</p>

<p>
So even as a engineer worried about the quality of my design and the
correctness of my features, I would like an overview of where
complexity is accumulating.

<h2 id="org6df4afe">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6df4afe">
<p>
As I anticipated in <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/12/life-is-a-cycle-why-periodic-behaviour-is-good-for-your-health">my previous post</a>, the "hotspot" analysis makes
complexity easy to discover. Here a picture to get the idea:
</p>


<div id="orgfc47d0e" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
You will see a diagram with circle within circles. The biggest circle
represents the repository and the included circles represent packages
and modules. The empty circles, i.e. the modules, may be a shade of
red. The redder the more often they have changed. The more they
changed the more likely they contain quality problems. If these
circles are also large then they likely have too many responsibilities
because their code may have to change for different reasons.
</p>

<p>
The red circles are "hotspots", because they have suffered the highest
frequency of change. A healthy codebase tends to have few hotspots and
the size of its modules similarly small.
</p>

<p>
The example above represents the <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad">XMonad</a> repository (a X window manager
written in Haskell) and you can see in the bottom right a circle that
is both red and bigger than other modules. That is the <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/blob/master/src/XMonad/Operations.hs">Operations.hs</a>
file that is about 700 lines and changed about 255 times from the
beginning of the repository.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea of how XMonad works, but with this graph I have already
a way to help maintainers handle their codebase complexity. Not only
that, but I can explore the codebase structure without looking at a
single line of code. Furthermore I can easily see where developers
have been working lately (by reducing the scope of the analysis to the
last week or month).
</p>

<p>
I found out that this picture is useful to share knowledge about
software health with business people.
</p>

<p>
But let's get into the important bit: how can your Emacs produce that
for you?
</p>

<p>
I assume you <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/11/emacsconf2020-first-steps-towards-emacs-becoming-your-code-compass/">followed</a> the <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass/blob/main/README.org">installation instructions</a> already and you
just need to clone the latest version of the repository.
</p>

<p>
Next the following video shows how to use the <code>c/show-hotpsots</code>
command of code-compass:
</p>

<p>
  <video width="420" height="240" controls>
    <source src="/assets/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/howtoHotspotsAnalysis.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <a href="/assets/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/howtoHotspotsAnalysis.mp4">/assets/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/howtoHotspotsAnalysis.mp4</a>
  </video>
</p>

<p>
You may notice that in the video I type "beginning", after selecting
the root directory of the target repository. In that way I am saying
to use the full history of the repository for the analysis. You can
use TAB or your preferred completion system to show other options: in
general you can set any number N of days or months ago with options
looking like "Nd" or "Nm", for example to show the analysis of last
week I would have typed "7d".
</p>

<p>
If you want to test this out in a fresh Emacs, you can save the
following snippet in <code>/tmp/code-compass-minimal-setup.el</code> (always
assuming you got external dependencies like Docker, code-maat, cloc,
etc...):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(require 'package)
(eval-and-compile
  (setq
   package-archives
   '(("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/")
     ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
     ("marmalade"   . "https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
     ("org"         . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
     ("gnu"         . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))))
(package-initialize)

 ;;; Bootstrap use-package
;; Install use-package if it's not already installed.
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
(setq use-package-always-ensure 't)
(require 'use-package)
(require 'diminish)
(require 'bind-key)
(use-package async)
(use-package dash)
(use-package f)
(use-package s)
(use-package simple-httpd)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
At this point open a terminal in the code-compass repository and run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">emacs -Q -l /tmp/code-compass-minimal-setup.el -l code-compass.el
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With a <code>M-x c/show-hotspots</code> you can pick any directory containing a
Git repository and generate your own interactive graph (it will ask
you ).
</p>

<p>
Welcome to the world of code analysis within Emacs!

<h2 id="org51c6f74">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51c6f74">
<p>
In this post I showed how to make the first step in transforming Emacs
in your code compass! Just clone <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass/blob/main/README.org">the repository</a> and start analyzing
your Git repositories.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes soon I will introduce you to the code-compass command that
makes hotspots snapshots of your repository so you can notice your
hotspots evolution. And this is only about a single repository!
Microservices hotspot analysis coming soon too.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, analyzing modules complexity via indentation is the next
feature of code-compass for us: stay tuned!
</p>

<p>
Happy code-travelling!
