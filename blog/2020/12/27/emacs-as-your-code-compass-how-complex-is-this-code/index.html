<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: how complex is this code?</h1>

<div id="outline-container-orge6a008d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge6a008d">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge6a008d">
<p>
Find out how complex is your (indented) code by using <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>'
<code>c/calculate-complexity-current-buffer</code>. The best way to interpret
that score is to integrate the time dimension: use
<code>c/show-complexity-over-commits</code> to see how complex your code became
over the last commits.
</p>

<h2 id="org26b6615">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org26b6615">
<p>
Often I am so absorbed by the problem at hand that when my code gets
to the review stage, I find comments like: "Mmm, can you make it more
readable?". I know I should not rush to the review, but it happens
that I have some other work in progress that distracts me. That makes
me forget to "empathically" review my code before clicking the "open
pull request" button.
</p>

<p>
(Meanwhile I master sequential problem solving) If only I had a way to
quantify code complexity, maybe I could make my preferred editor to
stop me at the right time?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9bb4cf9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9bb4cf9">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9bb4cf9">
<p>
Code that is hard to read is a serious issue. Give it enough time and
I cannot tell the meaning of my own code! Indeed, time erases from my
memory why I structured code in a certain way and why I chose those
random names for variables and functions (and luckily so, because
otherwise I would not have mental space for my future!).
</p>

<p>
This is troublesome for my code, and extremely so for organizations
because of the quantity of engineers involved (with different
backgrounds) and their turnover. This feed the cycle of architectural
decay and technical debt.
</p>

<p>
We already saw we can find this out with the <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/">hotspot
analysis</a>, and we shall do better: we need a way to quantify how worse
or how better we are making code for future maintainers!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0d5647a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0d5647a">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0d5647a">
<p>
There are a bunch of ways to calculate a complexity score, one of the
many being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a>. The simplest, roughest and also
language agnostic is code indentation.
</p>

<p>
Given your code follows a uniform indentation scheme (Emacs has a tons
of amazing packages for that), you can easily see if a piece of code
is difficult to read. For example, check out the following pieces of
code to get the idea (they are meaningless, so ignore the semantics):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(defun someCommonLispFunction (someInput)
  (if (&gt; someImput 0)
      (if (&gt; someImput 1)
          (if (&gt; someImput 3)
              "bigger than 3"
              (if (= someImput 3)
                  "equal to 3"
                  "..."))
          "...")))
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(let ((someInput 1))
  (let ((someOtherInput 2))
    (+
     (if someInput
         1
         2)
     (when someOtherInput
       3))))
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(setf a 1)
(setf b 1)
(+ a b)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I made these up randomly with the only aim to show you how difficult
to read is code with too much (unnecessary) nesting.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see other examples in your favourite programming
language, check out
<a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata</a>, which is
also a useful refactoring kata.
</p>

<p>
The point is that your computer can calculate a complexity score
easily: just sum up the units of indentation appearing in the code.
</p>

<p>
The unit of indentation for the Common Lisp code above is two spaces.
So the calculation of complexity for each block results in:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">block</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-right">complexity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">block with if statements</td>
<td class="org-right">46</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">block with let statements</td>
<td class="org-right">20.5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">block with setf</td>
<td class="org-right">0.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
In my experience I agree with that score when I am reviewing, and
<a href="https://softwareprocess.es/static/WhiteSpace.html">researchers found indentation to be a good rough metric to indicate
complexity</a>.
</p>

<p>
Clearly I use this metric as an indication. So rather than looking at
the raw number, I look for deltas: I want to see how much my change
increases and decreases this complexity value.
</p>

<p>
This is why code-compass implements <code>c/show-complexity-over-commits</code>,
which lets you see how complexity of a buffer has increased or
decreased over the last few commits. The graph you obtain looks like
this:
</p>


<div id="orgff27eb2" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020/12/27/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-complex-is-this-code/XMonadOperationsHs.png" alt="XMonadOperationsHs.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that I put complexity in relation to lines of code so that I
notice if a spike in complexity is due to a lot of new code added to
the file (and this is typical indeed).
</p>

<p>
Now equipped with this graph, I can find a bit more easily when my
changes are a bit too complex to open a pull request :)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org538030a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org538030a">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org538030a">
<p>
So grab the last version of <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> and find out how complex is
your code by running <code>c/calculate-complexity-current-buffer</code> on a
buffer! Or checking the differential in complexity a file experienced
with <code>c/show-complexity-over-commits</code>.
</p>

<p>
This way you can evaluate the time future maintainers will have to
invest in understanding your code, and save that for them.
</p>

<p>
Happy simplifying!
