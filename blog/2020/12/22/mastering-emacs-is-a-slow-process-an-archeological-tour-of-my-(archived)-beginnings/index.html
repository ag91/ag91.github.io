<h1>Mastering Emacs is a slow process: an archeological tour of my (archived) beginnings</h1>
<p>
If you are reading this, I guess you may be on your way to Emacs
enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
Here I want to give you an (archaeological) taste of how I started
with it. I hope that this will give you also a sense of how long it
took me to get comfortable with this amazing tool <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Ideally, new users that
read this will feel comfortable even if, after some months of
struggling, they have not yet tamed Emacs: as all the best things in
life, learning Emacs takes time and dedication.
</p>

<p>
I started using Emacs towards the end of 2013, the beginning of my
Ph.D. There must be a strong connection between academia's need to
publish elegant scientific work (i.e., LaTex) and the adoption of
Emacs <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I know that I started roughly then because the oldest Org
Archive entry I could find is the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">* DONE Buy Christmas return ticket &lt;2013-11-09 Sat&gt;                
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ARCHIVE_TIME: 2016-03-25 Fri 14:41
  :ARCHIVE_FILE: ~/.when/todos/myTasks.org
  :ARCHIVE_OLPATH: Daily Stuff
  :ARCHIVE_CATEGORY: myTasks
  :ARCHIVE_TODO: DONE
  :END:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Something interesting is that my first archived note tells us what I
was using before Org Mode for my calendar: <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/when/when.html">when</a> by Benjamin Crowell
<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. You can guess that from the
directory in which I was storing my main Org file.
</p>

<p>
This reminded me how powerful is to archive your tasks for later
memory.
</p>

<p>
I guess by that point I already familiarized with the basic Emacs
editing commands: cancelling an action <code>C-g</code>, undoing an edit <code>C-/</code>,
killing <code>C-w</code> and yanking text <code>C-y</code> (i.e., copy/pasting), visit files
<code>C-x C-f</code>, and load modes specific to programming languages via the
init file (I was writing Bash, Java, Haskell, C#, OCaml, Python and
Scala during my studies).
</p>

<p>
I guess Erc, Emacs' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> mode, entered my life a year after, when I
took note of a chat important for my research:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">* DONE have chat with IRC ocaml &lt;2014-10-22 Wed&gt;                   
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ARCHIVE_TIME: 2016-03-25 Fri 14:40
  :ARCHIVE_FILE: ~/.when/todos/myTasks.org
  :ARCHIVE_OLPATH: Ph.D.
  :ARCHIVE_CATEGORY: myTasks
  :ARCHIVE_TODO: DONE
  :END:

    http://irclog.whitequark.org/ocaml
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice how I must have still been unaware of Org source blocks and
quotations at that time because I was just pasting the raw chat under
the heading as a way to log things.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of a Ph.D. is, mainly, the final thesis, so I started
writing my research down in a Org file early on. Emacs'
<a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/gscholar-bibtex">gscholar-bibtex</a> helped a lot with managing references for my LaTex
bibliography:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">* add gscholar extension to emacs to get bibtex info directly in emacs &lt;2015-11-03 Tue&gt; 
  :PROPERTIES:

  :ARCHIVE_OLPATH: On the fly
  :ARCHIVE_CATEGORY: myTasks
  :END:
use M-x gscholar-bibtex

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Today, if you need a bibliography, you should surely look also into
<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">org-ref</a>.
</p>

<p>
I guess 2016 was the turning point for my customization of Emacs. I
started using org-contacts for keeping track of birthdays and I
finally found the need for Org Archive (all the entries I found were
archived on that year).
</p>

<p>
Immediately after that came the installation of <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">magit</a> and wdired:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

Evidently I needed a sweeter and efficient way to both manage Git
repositories and modify my file system contents swiftly. Note how I
was taking notes of keybindings cheatsheets as Org tables: it really
takes time for muscle memory to kick in!
</p>

<p>
My big challenge as a new Emacs user, which I can still remember with
uneasiness, was to setup <a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu/tree/master/mu4e">mu4e</a> to read my emails:
</p>

<p>
It felt difficult because I needed to integrate multiple pieces of
software while still being a bit uncomfortable with how configuring
Emacs itself.
</p>

<p>
Again it is funny to discover that I had an actual reason to start
managing emails from within Emacs other than being a geek: at that
time Mozilla ended maintenance for Thunderbird, my previous preferred
email client.
</p>

<p>
Few months later I learned how to maintain my Emacs configuration as
an Org Mode file by copying <a href="https://github.com/durantschoon/.emacs.d">Daniel Mai</a>'s approach.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">* DONE move to org and use-package 
  SCHEDULED:&lt;2016-06-21 Tue&gt;
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ARCHIVE_TIME: 2016-06-21 Tue 01:06
  :ARCHIVE_FILE: ~/workspace/agenda/myTasks.org
  :ARCHIVE_OLPATH: Daily Stuff
  :ARCHIVE_CATEGORY: myTasks
  :ARCHIVE_TODO: DONE
  :END:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
More importantly I started using <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> for my dependencies. At
that time I introduced use-package mainly because of its clean syntax.
Only much later I learned how to use it to load packages lazily and
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/08/07/how-i-inspected-my-emacs-configuration-and-discovered-once-again-org-mode-people-are-smart/">instrument my configuration to find out initialization problems</a>. By
the way, that time must have also been when I started preferring the
<code>SCHEDULED</code> timestamp format to Org raw dates.
</p>

<p>
From then on I started installing programming environments within
Emacs, like <a href="https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs">Ensime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg">Tuareg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">Cider</a>. I also bugged a significant
amount of times <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">Pandoc</a>'s maintainers to support all the features I
needed to export my thesis written in Org Mode via the amazing
<a href="https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc">ox-pandoc</a>.
</p>

<p>
All in all, Emacs was a majestic investment: I basically
literate-programmed away my Ph.D. activities via Org Mode and
completed the numerous todos with all the extensions Emacs support.
</p>


<p>
If you are a new user, a possible checklist to familiarize with Emacs is:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>learn the basics keybindings with the Emacs tutorial <code>C-h t</code></li>
<li>start using Org Mode to keep track of your todos</li>
<li>explore how to extend your Emacs to fulfill your needs, where good
resources for this are
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html</a> (this is also in you Emacs <code>C-h r</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/">https://orgmode.org/manual/</a> (this is also in you Emacs <code>C-h r</code> and then search for "Org Mode")</li>
<li><a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">https://planet.emacslife.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide">https://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>


<p>
Again I wish my beginnings (about 3 years actually!) with Emacs
let you get that learning this tool is a process. So no rush and enjoy
each struggle (and get in touch with the lovely community please)!
</p>

<p>
Happy enlightening!
