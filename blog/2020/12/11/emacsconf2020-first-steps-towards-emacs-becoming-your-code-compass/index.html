<h1>EmacsConf2020: first steps towards Emacs becoming your code compass!</h1>

Finally I am releasing the code I presented <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/24/">for code analyses at
EmacsConf2020</a>. I will publish posts and code weekly, and you can find
everything <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">here</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8ca6bc9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8ca6bc9">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8ca6bc9">
<p>
Good software comes from understanding what clients want and code that
down for them effectively. Although the first part requires skill, the
second part is often less effective than I would like.
</p>

<p>
When I want to modify an existing code base, typically I need to
understand why others designed things in a certain way, refactor that,
and then add my stuff in. Often this process is difficult because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>code design has hidden assumptions</li>
<li>no documentation</li>
<li>maybe tests</li>
<li>nobody around knows anything about that code</li>
</ul>

<p>
So between requirement elicitation meetings and careful investigation
<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> to guess what the code is doing...
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/09/26/life-is-short-but-not-short-enough-to-skip-planning/">decision
fatigue again</a>, help!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3755c3e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3755c3e">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3755c3e">
<p>
This is really a pain because sometimes we ourselves make the
situation worst without realizing in our development effort. Over time
this accumulating "imperfections" slow us down dramatically, a
phenomenon known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE">tech debt</a>.
</p>

<p>
Even worse, there a lot of "we" in a software project: so the more
everybody rushes for adding their feature, the more the aggregated
code base becomes cryptic.
</p>

<p>
If only I could get some guidance in how to deal with this ever
increasing complexity!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgea12844" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgea12844">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgea12844">
<p>
And luckily there is a way! The secret iiiisssss... in your <code>.git</code>
directory.
</p>

<p>
This year I read <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/">Your Code as a Crime Scene</a> by Adam Tornhill (and his
<a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/atevol/software-design-x-rays/">follow up book</a>), and I got enlightened: Git (or any version control
system) really is our history keeper. In general we can learn much
more from history than we actually try to do (e.g., in human history a
pandemic has often run three contagion waves, the second being the
toughest...). Learning from history applies to software too!
</p>

<p>
What if I can see where my technical debt is accumulating? What if I
can get an alert when I unconsciously accumulate it? And what if Emacs
can tell me that while I am coding?!? Just dig and interpret your git
data with a bit of Elisp :)
</p>

<p>
In my recent <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/24/">talk at EmacsConf2020</a> I show what I got so far bringing
Adam's analyses to Emacs.
</p>

<p>
My aim is much more ambitious though: I want my preferred <del>OS</del> editor
to become my compass pointing towards high quality and effective text
editing! (Note here I say text, not code: I am certain writers can
benefit of this too. And I will put effort into testing this idea out
soon!!)
</p>

<p>
For now, I am slowly integrating the results of these analyses to
actively enhance my development.
</p>

<p>
Think of Emacs telling me who I can ask for help, or what files I
should modify after this according to what other did in the past, or
even warn me if a commit as added too much complexity to the code,
remembering me to refactor.
</p>

<p>
Again I want Emacs to point me towards a more effective way of
developing <b>without becoming an obstacle</b>.
</p>

<p>
I have finally started a repository here:
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">https://github.com/ag91/code-compass</a>. I will extend this with what I
have developed so far at a (hopefully) weekly pace so that I can
explain with a blog post what the analysis is about and how I use it.
</p>

<p>
Note that I will initially support Git version control only, but I am
open to PR and contributions. Also I would love to hear feedback and
ideas to make this more useful for you. I am already investigating
some suggestions I got during EmacsConf2020 (which was a wonderful and
chill event, by the way).
</p>

<p>
I hope this Emacs extension will be useful to you too!
</p>

<p>
Next week: how to find technical debt and design decay at a glance
with hotspots!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org05c11bc">
<p>
This has been mostly an announcement post, because for now I have only
defined the dependencies needed for code-compass. So stay tuned for
next week, in which we will get into one of the core insights you can
get from your git history.
