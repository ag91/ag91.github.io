<h1>Linux, Unix Philosophy and why programs are just filters</h1>
<p>
I am a passionate reader and it is years that I work on operating
systems based on Linux. 
</p>

<p>
I confess that although reading tiny bits here and there, I never went
in depth about what design principles Unix was built upon. For
example, why <code>cd</code> is not <code>change-directory</code>? And why is all based on
pipes, and <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>?
</p>

<p>
I am sure the Internet has all this information scattered around
somewhere. However I really was looking for a consistent narration of
why Unix and Linux are like we see them today.
</p>

<p>
I am convinced that just grasping the basics of how large and reliable
software systems are built can boost your skills as an engineer.
</p>

<p>
And there I find it: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2084939.Linux_and_the_Unix_Philosophy">Linux and Unix Philosophy by Mike Gancarz</a> laying
there in my reading list!
</p>

<p>
So let's start from the juicy part: programs are data filters. The
point, in the words of the author, is that "Programs do not create
data, people do". This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnu1E5Kslig">left me wonder</a>. If you think about it, it is a
banal truth that carries a lot of meaning. 
</p>

<p>
Any program we write ingest data and transforms that to something
useful. But it does not generate the data in the first place. A
program without data is useless, and we people are the data providers.
The side effect of this is that functional programming is trendy for a
reason: when you grasp how to use functions like <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>
you already belong to the functional community and also you are
explicitly making your programs filter data.
</p>

<p>
So with that I looked at <code>|</code>, the pipe symbol, differently: that
operator lets you compose your programs, i.e., your filters. (By the
way, did you know the pipe operator passes partial results to the
composed programs? Roughly speaking, <code>cat file | grep
"someWord"</code> will not wait <code>cat</code> to pass the whole file contents to <code>grep</code>,
instead <code>grep</code> will work line by line).
</p>

<p>
And that brings us to the other design principle: "Choose portability
over efficiency". In Unix and Linux everything is a file: directories,
<code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, processes, et cetera, are all files. The point here
is that text files are portable, no strange byte conversions and
similar. Anybody can open a file, it is standard, easy to share, and
an abstraction around which you can build software that is uniform.
</p>

<p>
"Small is beautiful" is the last principle I want to consider in this
post. This has much in common with Rich Hickey's talk <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Simple made
easy</a>: you want to prefer uni-functional programs. If your programs do
a single thing, it is more likely you will write them correctly. Then
to achieve your goal you can just compose your programs. The author
calls this software leverage: the idea is that delivering and
composing multiple small programs is more than delivering a single
program that does the same. The reason is that you can reuse
uni-functional programs in many different contexts.
</p>

<p>
An extra thing I want to mention is an interesting thought about the
Agile community: Agile people have re-branded and made popular most of
the Unix principles under the name of eXtreme Programming, Scrum,
etc... Fundamentally fast prototyping, quick iterations and minimal
bureaucracy (did I mention that all programs are as minimal as
possible, even the naming conventions are i.e. <code>cd</code> vs
<code>change-directory</code>) were all already around from a long time before we
entered the Agile era (and luckily enough I would say!). 
</p>

<p>
(This kind of borrowing ideas reminds me of another worth read I did
recently which is "<a href="https://austinkleon.com/steal/">Steal Like an Artist</a>" that was suggested by an
interesting YouTuber <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/">Ali Abdaal</a>, who was brought to my attention from
a post of the <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?tag=emacs">Irreal</a> blog.)
</p>

<p>
In conclusion this book's gift is a compact list of guidelines to
design your programs and leverage composition of small programs with a
single responsibility. Also, I am grateful that Mike decided to
include this quote by his manager:
</p>

<p>
"Software is never finished. It is only delivered." And indeed, I
strongly agree that interpreting a project as an iteration helps a lot
in reducing stress.
</p>

<p>
Hope you will have time to look this book up too at some point!
