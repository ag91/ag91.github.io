<h1>Becoming Glamorous: from 0 to a Wardley map in GlamorousToolkit</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org0ae2e75" class="outline-2">

You can program <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">GlamorousToolkit</a> (GT) even with no knowledge of <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>.
Here I show how I made a Wardley map all by myself (and GT own examples).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge2ab580" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge2ab580">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge2ab580">
<p>
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/04/26/sustainable-software-with-moldable-development/">I
wrote recently how I think Moldable Development is onto something
cool</a>. Then I thought, why not testing this in the wild? I learned
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map">Wardley maps</a> in
one of GT videos. This is a strategic tool focusing on business' value
and evolution. By business I mean anything that interests you. Anyway,
I knew that GT is able to create and display these maps.
</p>

<p>
The interesting challenge for my last ten minutes was: can I make a
Wardley map in GT with zero knowledge of SmallTalk/Pharo?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdedb6cb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdedb6cb">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdedb6cb">
<p>
This is a worthy challenge because it can prove a point: I need to
be able to extract information from my system. In this case GT is a
system that somebody else made. I do not know how that somebody else
made it. I have no guide on how to use it. Still I want to make a map
with it!
</p>

<p>
This is usual at work. I need to use a library or a service I did not
write to make some new feature. Often, I have also some time limit.
</p>

<p>
Just the other day I spent a few hours meeting colleagues to
understand the design of a new microservice. Then we had a mob session
to extend it to what my team needed. When I need to modify a very old
software, will I find the creators still there to help me?!
</p>

<p>
So the big question: will I need to get on GT's Discord channel to
have a usable Wardley map?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org54d3f9d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org54d3f9d">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org54d3f9d">
<p>
Incredibly not! In about ten minutes I had a pretty basic map (just a
point in an empty canvas, but still).
</p>

<p>
At the beginning I was a bit lost. This is the main screen, and I was unsure what to pick.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
I guessed I should try the "Coder" tab because "Playground" did not sound right: I am missing the basics!
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
This also was a bit overwhelming: a cascade of classes. I felt so a
newbie! Still I decided to put trust on the little search icon on the
top right!
</p>


<div id="org0b1f315" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/05/03/becoming-glamorous-from-0-to-a-wardley-map-in-glamoroustoolkit/screen-2021-05-02-23-37-56.jpg" alt="screen-2021-05-02-23-37-56.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Typing "WardleyMap" brought me to... more feelings of inexperience!
Still, after jumping in and back a few times, I noticed the
"#Packages" tag. I clicked on that hoping for an overview of the
classes useful to me.
</p>

<p>
Only while I am writing this I noticed that there were examples already in
this view. Instead, I just looked for some class that made sense to me.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of attempts I chose <code>GtWardleyMapModel</code> because the name
was short and on point.
</p>

<p>
And I found examples!
</p>


<div id="org2c0cc6a" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/05/03/becoming-glamorous-from-0-to-a-wardley-map-in-glamoroustoolkit/screen-2021-05-02-23-45-55.jpg" alt="screen-2021-05-02-23-45-55.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
After a bit of looking into them, I felt ready for my first "Playground" tab!
</p>


<div id="org54e26b2" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/05/03/becoming-glamorous-from-0-to-a-wardley-map-in-glamoroustoolkit/screen-2021-05-02-23-46-59.jpg" alt="screen-2021-05-02-23-46-59.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You can see that I started defining an empty map. Then I defined a
node. And then I composed the two.
</p>

<p>
The empty map was easy because I copied an example. For the node, I
needed to jump into another example and see how that was making nodes.
I learned also how to set positions, colors and labels, but I decided
to go minimal to save time.
</p>

<p>
Then I wondered if I could use an existing example in the
Playground. So, in the bottom bit I instantiated an example!
</p>


<div id="orgb6060f4" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/05/03/becoming-glamorous-from-0-to-a-wardley-map-in-glamoroustoolkit/screen-2021-05-02-23-52-48.jpg" alt="screen-2021-05-02-23-52-48.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is a complete Wardley map and comes directly from GT!
</p>

<p>
I am quite happy that I could get to a map by copying examples. I
enjoyed my small success! And all by myself, no Discord!
</p>

<p>
Also something for the functional programmers: there may be <del>dragons</del> state!
Look what happens if I run twice my snippet with "addNode".
</p>


<div id="orgd7255b4" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/05/03/becoming-glamorous-from-0-to-a-wardley-map-in-glamoroustoolkit/screen-2021-05-02-23-58-21.jpg" alt="screen-2021-05-02-23-58-21.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
GT complains that I try to add a node that I have added already!
SmallTalk is an object oriented language, and objects have a state.
Although I am unfamiliar with the GT way of raising errors, the string
was quite clear too. You just have to rerun all the snippets above to
reset the <code>aEmptyWardleyMap</code> object state.

<h2 id="org57eb3b7">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org57eb3b7">
<p>
It is pretty cool I could make a map without prior knowledge of Pharo
programming. This is a good start! And the interactive maps are sooo
cool!
</p>

<p>
Happy molding!
