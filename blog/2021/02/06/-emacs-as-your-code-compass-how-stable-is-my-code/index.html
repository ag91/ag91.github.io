Reliable things in life are important, so find the code that you can
rely upon! Some code in your repository is left alone for a long time.
That means that it is generally safe. Find it with code-compass
<code>c/show-stability-graph</code>: you just need to look for white circles.

<h2 id="org72f0347">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org72f0347">
<p>
Say we have a repository that has overgrown in functionality. It
contains all sort of things: from geolocation to authentication (and
maybe even some eastern egg that some developer unexpectedly added
in). What if we want to split this variegated functionality among
multiple repositories? One approach is to cluster code by feature and
then move these code clusters in new repositories. But what if people
are actively working on these features? Shall we surprise them with
our new structure? It would be amazing instead if find out the code
that is stable and untouched: that is surely ripe to move to a better
location!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org23b1691" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org23b1691">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org23b1691">
<p>
Finding stable parts of your code is convenient also from a quality
perspective. Things that do no change for a long time are likely to
have enough quality in them to avoid recent modification (or dead
code, which is somewhat the same). In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36517037-software-design-x-rays?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=i6DE6WnVxp&amp;rank=1">Software Design X-Rays</a>,
Adam Torhill writes: "The risk of a new bug decreases with every day
that passes. Thatâ€™s due to the interesting fact that the risk of
software faults declines with the age of the code" <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
This is interesting even for learning, because we can see what are the
characteristics of this code to reproduce them. Typically the design
of software produces stable code <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. If we just can learn from the
previous maintainers how to design and implement stable code, we can
have a code base that stays reliable.

<h2 id="org1fae044">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1fae044">
<p>
Code ages. The bad of this is that we gradually forget what the old
code is doing, the good thing is that if old code stays untouched it
is likely that is reliable. We saw that the hotspot tells us which
parts of the code are really active and likely buggy. Code stability
is basically the inverse of that analysis.
</p>

<p>
You can produce a stability graph with code-compass's command
<code>=c/show-stability-graph</code>. The graph looks like the following:
</p>


<div id="org677504b" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/02/06/-emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-stable-is-my-code/codeage.jpg" alt="codeage.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The clearer the white the older is the last modification on the code.
You can then see how easily it is to spot clusters of modules that
have been left by themselves for a long time. If circles are blue it
means that they have been modified recently. Apparently the <code>Org</code>
module of Pandoc is still actively modified while the <code>Docx</code> is
growing older and stable.
</p>

<p>
Again this analysis is interactive, let me show you how to run it:
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/02/06/-emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-stable-is-my-code/code-age.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/02/06/-emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-stable-is-my-code/code-age.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
By the way, be aware of the grey circles! These modules are neither
stable nor unstable, which means they get changes sporadically. This
may likely imply that people are modifying them without having a clear
idea of the design decisions they originated with. And that may result
in subtle errors!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge3fb831" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge3fb831">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge3fb831">
<p>
So find out the safe zones in your code base. You can then move them
in libraries if you need to. And maybe you can try to document the
partially stable modules so you can decrease the chances that sporadic
maintainers introduce errors. Just get <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>, run
<code>c/show-stability-graph</code>, and look for the white circles!

Happy aging!
