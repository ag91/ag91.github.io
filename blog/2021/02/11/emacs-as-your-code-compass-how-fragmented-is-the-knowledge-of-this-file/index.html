<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: how fragmented is the knowledge of this file?</h1>
<div id="outline-container-org175f640" class="outline-2">

Have you ever wondered how fragmented is the knowledge about a file?
Your repository history can tell you that: just use <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>'s
<code>show-fragmentation</code>!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org55de9ec" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org55de9ec">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org55de9ec">
<p>
The more heads at a meeting the more difficult is to take a decision.
How does this translate to software? In successful projects multiple
authors work together on enhancing software over time. <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/">We saw already
that multiple changes increase the likelihood of errors</a>. So what
happens when people have collaborated over a long time? And when we
find a file that has been modified by dozens of authors should we
worry?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgde2608f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgde2608f">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgde2608f">
<p>
Say we realize a file has got many authors, and we already know who is
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/02/06/-emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-stable-is-my-code/">the primary author from our knowledge map</a>: what do we know about the
familiarity of other authors with the code at hand? How much do they
know? What if the main author is actually just about as knowledgeable
as anyone else? Would it not be amazing to see these details in a nice
visualization? Once this becomes visible, we can assess if the
knowledge fragmentation of this file is a problem or not.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf9dfa9f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf9dfa9f">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf9dfa9f">
<p>
You can visualize knowledge fragmentation because this information is
in your repository history (or at least a proxy: you are always the
best at assessing this by chatting with the protagonists). The
quickest way to extract this information (if you are a terminal savvy)
is running the following command in your repository:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">git shortlog HEAD -n -s -- code-compass.el
</pre>
</div>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-right" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-right">11</td>
<td class="org-left">ag91</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-right">8</td>
<td class="org-left">Blank Spruce</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
This shows how many commits the authors have contributed to the given
file (in this case <code>code-compass</code> itself). This can look rather
different for a bigger codebase:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">git shortlog HEAD -n -s -- RemoteWebDriver.java
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is the result for a file in <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium">Selenium</a>, a project much older and
known than code-compass.
</p>

<p>
The example in Selenium shows you that there are two maintainers that
likely know as much as each other. Still thick threads of knowledge
are spread among other contributors. This file happens also to be a
hotspot in the Selenium code base, so there is a chance that
fragmentation of knowledge may be hiding both errors and design decay.
</p>

<p>
I like to use a slightly more visual approach to fragmentation though.
Also I think that knowledge is more about the lines of code you add
and delete from a file than the times you commit. So I use <a href="https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat">code-maat</a>
to look for the authors contribution to a file and calculate the sum
of the additions and deletions they contributed to the code. Using
commits or lines of code should not yield significantly different
results, but I prefer the latter.
</p>

<p>
The visualization comes in two formats, according to your preference.
For example if you call <code>c/show-fragmentation</code> on <code>code-compass.el</code>,
you can produce the following pictures:
</p>


<div id="orgd5cc97c" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/02/11/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-fragmented-is-the-knowledge-of-this-file/pie-code-compass.jpg" alt="pie-code-compass.jpg" />
</p>
</div>


<div id="org2539f8d" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/02/11/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-fragmented-is-the-knowledge-of-this-file/bar-code-compass.jpg" alt="bar-code-compass.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If you prefer the bar chart over the pie chart, you have to just customize <code>c/pie-or-bar-chart-command</code> like the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(setq c/pie-or-bar-chart-command "graph %s --bar --width 0.4 --offset='-0.2,0.2'")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Where the <code>--width</code> and <code>--offset</code> options are at your own discretion,
I just proposed what works for me.
</p>

<p>
If we return to our wild example <code>RemoteWebDriver.java</code>, things look
like this:
</p>


<div id="orga691b4c" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/02/11/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-fragmented-is-the-knowledge-of-this-file/selenium-fragmentation.jpg" alt="selenium-fragmentation.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
From the lines of code analysis you can see that there is a slightly
more significant division in knowledge between the two main
contributors of <code>RemoteWebDriver.java</code>. If you would like to see
clearly the percentages overlapping, just use the "lens" icon on the
top-left toolbar and make a rectangular region with your mouse: it will
zoom in to see the small percentages more clearly (you can go back
with the arrow icons in the same toolbar).
</p>

<p>
Now you can visualize knowledge fragmentation: what next?
Fragmentation, as an hotspot, has a simple solution: rewrite the file.
If the design decayed over time, you have just to understand what was
the aim of the software. Then you can rewrite a more synthetic and
coherent software to substitute it. Ideally, you can divide the file
in multiple smaller parts which are easier to reason about and require
less or no further modification. This also reminds me why the Unix
people said "worse is better": have small units of software that you
can compose to provide what you need. They are easier to understand,
require less modifications and you can leverage for more use cases.
</p>

<p>
Well, now another tool for fragmentation discovery is in your hands!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org05d0b26" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org05d0b26">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org05d0b26">
<p>
This is the time: do you have a file that is difficult to understand?
Check if it has tons of authors and how much they know about it with
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> <code>c/show-fragmentation</code> (or the plain Git command I showed
above). Then, if that file is really a pain, socialize with them and
try to write a better version of it!
</p>

<p>
Happy condensation!
