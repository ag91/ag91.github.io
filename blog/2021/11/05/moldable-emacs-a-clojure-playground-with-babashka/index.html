<h1>Moldable Emacs: a Clojure Playground with Babashka</h1>

<div id="outline-container-orga1ecee8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga1ecee8">Too long; didn't read</h2>

There is a Playground for Clojure now. You need a <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a> connection to
use it and with <a href="https://github.com/babashka/babashka">babashka</a> is even cooler!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org247117a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org247117a">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org247117a">
<p>
When I finished to implement my first mold, the Playground, I remember
I had this thought: "wouldn't it be cool to have a Playground in the
language you like?". That was also <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/issues/1">the first issue</a> of <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a>.
Then I moved on and I forgot about it.
</p>

<p>
Until the other day, when I had this cool work task about finding out
team ratio between planned and unplanned work. Long story short,
moldable-emacs was a great ally to solve it. After a couple of hours
of hacking, there I go with a reproducible analysis. Here my problem:
reproducible only by me. Unluckily few people use Emacs at work and I
am the only one using my mode.
</p>

<p>
The thing my colleagues have in common though is that they are
Clojurians. So even if they don't use Emacs, they do use Clojure. The
Playground is in Elisp. So... <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clomacs">clomacs</a>? Not this time. For work stuff I
want to write my scripts in Clojure!
</p>

<p>
Then another analysis task comes along, moldable-emacs would be great
again! What shall I do?!?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfd826a2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfd826a2">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd826a2">
<p>
Apart of the need to reproduce work (to spot errors and improve upon
it), a polyglot workflow is fun. Indeed, Org Babel is a show-off of
marvels. When I chain Bash, JavaScript, and Elisp to get what I need
is a joy. Each language has strengths. It feels an amazing freedom to
compose these strengths into a flow of data. Moldable-emacs works well
to unify data representations, but its main language remains Elisp. I
mean you can move to JSON to a plist and back, but you still have to
express yourself in Elisp. Even if JavaScript is just better at
surfing JSON.
</p>

<p>
Can we do a first step in that direction?

<h2 id="orgfde5631">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfde5631">
<p>
Since I need to share Clojure with others, let's start from there. I
wanted a way to easily reproduce a Clojure script. In the sense that I
don't want to create a project, if I were to need some external
library. In Scala I would have picked something like <a href="https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite">Ammonite</a> to back
up my foreign Playground. So, I ended up learning that the cool
Clojure kid of the block is babashka these days. And I totally agree.
The beautiful mind that gave us <a href="https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo">clj-kondo</a> gave as a nice way of
scripting in Clojure too. And babashka fits perfectly with <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a>, the
mode I use to enhance my Clojure dev experience. So I wrote a new
mold.
</p>

<p>
The main dependency of this mold is cider. Babashka is just an
insurance that the code in my Playground is going to be easy to share.
</p>

<p>
I made also an "Eval With Clojure" mold to evaluate the last Clojure
sexp. Let me show how it all works together.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/11/05/moldable-emacs-a-clojure-playground-with-babashka/ClojurePlayground.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/11/05/moldable-emacs-a-clojure-playground-with-babashka/ClojurePlayground.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
As you can see, I picked the babashka example that fetches the latest
tag of the project <a href="https://github.com/babashka/babashka/tree/master/examples">here</a>. After connecting <code>cider</code>, I evaluate the
<code>require</code> and the function, and I get the latest tag! And by the way,
you can see that I can also evaluate <code>self</code> (in the Elisp REPL).
</p>

<p>
That is indeed the bit that I care about: data integration. The
implementation of the mold follows.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(me-register-mold
 :key "Playground Clojure"
 :given (:fn (and (me-require 'clojure-mode)))
 :then (:fn
        (let* ((tree (ignore-errors self)))
          (with-current-buffer buffername
            (clojure-mode)
            (erase-buffer)
            (insert ";; Tips:\n;;    Use `self' to access the mold context.\n;;    You can access the previous mold context through `mold-data'.\n\n")
            (ignore-errors
              (when (cider-connected-p) (cider-nrepl-sync-request:eval (format "(def self '%s)" (let ((x self)) (with-temp-buffer (me-print-to-buffer x)
                                                                                                                                  (buffer-string)))))))
            (setq-local self tree))))
 :docs "You can play around with code in Clojure."
 :examples ...)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can see that the <code>self</code> is only set if cider is connected (the bit
with <code>(cider-connected-p)</code>). This is pretty sketchy because the
setting of <code>self</code> may fail. Also we miss <code>mold-data</code>, which contains
old mold information. It is still available from the Elisp side, but
not in the cider session. Still, I believe it is a good first&amp;tiny
step for polyglot molding!
</p>

<p>
And I could share how I made my analysis with my colleagues: so success!
</p>

<p>
The way I did was to develop my Playground, add a <code>#!/usr/bin/env bb</code>
at the top and that was it. Before developing I just needed to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>run babashka nrepl: <code>(async-shell-command "bb nrepl-server 1667")</code></li>
<li>connect cider to that with <code>cider-connect-clj</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
You can connect to any nrepl session. We leverage cider superpowers!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7b977f2">
<p>
The first polyglot mold! As you can see, even if others don't use
moldable-emacs, you can still share your data transformation. It is a
bit ad-hoc, but it is possible. And if you are a Clojurian, well it is
ready to use.
</p>

<p>
Happy polyglotting!
