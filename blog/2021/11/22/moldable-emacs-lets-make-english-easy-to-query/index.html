<h1>Moldable Emacs: let&#39;s make English easy to query!</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org68f9934" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org68f9934">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org68f9934">
<p>
This is about an experiment to parse text with NLP software so that we
can ask our text questions!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgca21c43" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgca21c43">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgca21c43">
<p>
Lately I have been spending time querying my code. I have been asking
mostly basic things: how many functions has this file? How complex are
those? How many functions in the whole project? Now I am finally (and
slowly) getting into more complex queries, but then I said to myself:
"wait! Let's try with English now".
</p>

<p>
My thinking is: if I can recognize things like functions in code, in
text I should find things like predicates. Or objects, or subjects or
sentences that depend on others. Since we have fancy stuff like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/">GT-3</a>,
I was hopeful to find some software I could plug in <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a> to
obtain some structural information for text.
</p>

<p>
So I wondered: how would this work?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbc846eb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbc846eb">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbc846eb">
<p>
Imagine structural editing for English. I mean Emacs already lets you
move words, paragraphs and sentences all over the place, if you like.
But what about predicates? And what about finding me all the sentences
that have "pear" as subject? By structural editing I mean to change
the subject of those sentences from pear to orange.
</p>

<p>
And what if we could lint our text by coming up with rules like:
"careful! 3 sentences contain recursive relative clauses: that is
difficult to read".
</p>

<p>
There is more though! How cool would be to query a book? Imagine you
have fond memories of a passage in a book. You can vaguely remember
that passage is about a prince and a snake. How cool would it be if
you can ask the book itself? Find me all those phrases that have as
subject a prince and as object a snake. We would at least have a more
fun at it than skimming through.
</p>

<p>
You could even filter your text to read only what you need!! How
exciting would that be?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3b4a399" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3b4a399">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b4a399">
<p>
Well, this is a pretty rough prototype that I haven't properly tested
yet. I am pretty excited about it, so this blog is more like a spoiler
of work in progress.
</p>

<p>
First things first, I have been looking for a low hanging fruit CLI to
a NLP model. I am not an expert of machine learning (yet XD), so I
wanted something plug&amp;play.
</p>

<p>
Looking at packages available via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a>, I fell onto <a href="https://github.com/emorynlp/elit">Elit</a>. Well, I don't
know much about this project, but plug&amp;play, right? Just playing
around.
</p>

<p>
After downloading a few GigaBytes of models (it is pretty usable, Elit does
all itself), I run elit in the command line for the first time:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">andrea@andrea-pc:/tmp$ elit parse
Moldable development is a way of programming through which you construct custom tools for each problem.

</div>

<p>
That returns the following:

<p>
Naturally I barely know what that means. Anyway, I seem to see a
<code>relcl</code> there: elit found a relative clause! That is encouraging.
Furthermore, that seem to be also in the "con" section of the JSON
output: <code>WHNP</code> seems to wrap just our relative clause (i.e., "which
you construct custom tools for each problem").
</p>

<p>
I discovered that the strange abbreviations (e.g, <code>JJ</code> and <code>NN</code>) are
types of nodes of the natural syntax tree.
</p>

<p>
I made a list to use later from an <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs474/2004fa/lec1.pdf">university lecture</a> I found online:

<p>
Anyway, that seemed promising, so I decided to make a mold out of it. Let's try it!
</p>

  </video>
</p>


<p>
You can see that I just mark some text and after a few seconds I get
an Elisp list with some of elit's information. I took just the "con"
bit for now, because it is an experiment. Also because I don't
understand most of the output of elit yet (and I am not sure I should
just yet).
</p>

<p>
The format in which I am showing the nodes is the same as the one for
code. The idea is indeed to keep the interface the same, so maybe we
could even ending up reusing things between the two.
</p>

<p>
In the video I also try a simple query! And you can see that I can
jump to the original text in just the same way I can for code nodes.
</p>

<p>
Well I just finished implementing this, so it is all I can show you for now.
</p>

<p>
(Note that I took a lot of shortcuts for this: for example, I patched
elit code to take a text file as input. Also the mold I have does not
handle newlines well -- the positions I get for the node become
imprecise).
</p>

<p>
All in all I am pretty happy that we are at a stage where I can hack
something usable in a couple of days of evening work!

<p>
This was just a bite of machine learning in moldable-emacs for you. We
can make Emacs understand English to let us query it. It is possible
:D I am not sure where this will head to, but the start is exciting!
</p>

<p>
Please get in touch if you have suggestions for better ML software or
ideas on how to use this feature. In the meanwhile I will try to
experiment and refine it, and post some more experiments.
</p>

<p>
Happy machine-reading!
