<h1>Following wise suggestions: making emacs-with-nyxt more consistent</h1>
<p>
This is a "thank you" post, really. Sometimes ago I shared my
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/emacs-with-nyxt/">emacs-with-nyxt</a> hack on Reddit, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nvdwgp/emacs_nyxt_and_enginemode_how_to_browse_urls_via/h139vz2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">the
user "trararawe" pointed out that there were too many <code>sleep-for</code> in
there</a>.
</p>

<p>
I confess it could have totally stayed a hack if that user didn't
inspire me to clean up my code: so thank you!
</p>

<p>
Since there is chance I could get some more nice suggestions, let me
explain what I did.
</p>

<p>
There are a few bits of the integration between Nyxt and Emacs that go
totally asynchronous.
</p>

<p>
The first is running Nyxt. When the browser starts it needs some setup
to be ready to use via Emacs. We cannot continue until Nyxt is ready.
The following code does the trick.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(async-shell-command (format "nyxt -e \"(nyxt-user::start-swank)\""))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That code will also start the Swank server to link to Slime. Since we
need to wait, I came up with waiting about half a second before
continuing. As "trararawe" said, guessing a time is fragile because my
system is different from others. Both we are wasting people time or we
are making them fail in starting Nyxt.
</p>

<p>
So I replaced that code with this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(async-shell-command (format "nyxt -e \"(nyxt-user::start-swank)\""))
(while (not (ignore-errors (not (emacs-with-nyxt-slime-connect "localhost" "4006"))))
  (sleep-for emacs-with-nyxt-slime-nyxt-delay))
(while (not (ignore-errors (string= "NYXT-USER" (slime-current-package))))
  (sleep-for emacs-with-nyxt-slime-nyxt-delay))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is a bit ugly, but still a solution. We now exploit Slime to tell
us when its connection is ready. When Slime establishes a connection
then we can assume Nyxt is ready too. If it is not, we wait a little
and try again. I should probably add a circuit break in there (to
eventually exit). Ehrm... anyhow. We do something similar in the next
line. You see, even if Swank is ready, the Nyxt Common Lisp package
may not be available yet. Lucky us, Slime can tell us which package is
available now. Nyxt set this to <code>NYXT-USER</code> by default. And this is
the package we wait to have.
</p>

<p>
Once these things are ready, we can start our interaction via the
Common Lisp REPL.
</p>

<p>
That is also another bit that is asynchronous. It seems that Slime
connects to Swank at its own time. So just to be sure, I added another
<code>while</code> loop that hold our horses until Slime is ready.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emacs-with-nyxt-slime-connect (host port)
  "Connect Slime to HOST and PORT ignoring version mismatches."
  (slime-connect host port)
  (while (not (slime-connected-p))
   (sleep-for emacs-with-nyxt-slime-nyxt-delay)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And that is it. With these I made the hack work without picking a
random waiting time.
</p>

<p>
Now if you have some other useful suggestion, I am happy to hear!
</p>

<p>
Happy Lisping!
