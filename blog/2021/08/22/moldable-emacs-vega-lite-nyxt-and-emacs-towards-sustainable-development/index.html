<h1>Moldable Emacs: Vega-Lite, Nyxt and Emacs towards sustainable development</h1>

Make plots interactive with Emacs! Merge visualizations, browsing and
editing in a unique experience. Here I show how great tools can join
hands to give you super powers.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org11a40c8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org11a40c8">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11a40c8">
<p>
<a href="https://moldabledevelopment.com">Moldable development</a> is about letting you create tools good for the
job at hand on the fly. It is about empowering you to deal with your
complex world. Now reading text is pretty hard. It takes time! And it
takes even more time to understand it.
</p>

<p>
Mathematicians for example train themselves to read formulas, but to
understand them they need to demo in their mind (or notepads) how a
formula would work with concrete examples. So if I write a formula
<code>x + y = ...</code>, a mathematician would replace the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with a
few numbers to see if my formula holds. Programmers at work have the
same issue. They use the machine to deal with testing their formulas
(the Lisp REPL ideally!). So reading a program, formula or just text
always requires testing it to fully understand.
</p>

<p>
Bret Victor did majestic work at showing how we need to stop demo
things in our minds. For example, <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">in developing a game you should be
able to see how your changes affect the gameplay</a>.
</p>

<p>
I want to move towards that! My tools must be richer than that though
and far cheaper to make.
</p>

<p>
It would be great to start from program execution. But I give priority
to data. We are getting more and more data from the world around us.
The problem is that we struggle understanding it and acting on it. For
example, there is a lot of data about climate change, but we still
struggle at extracting meaning from it. Then we struggle taking actions
(e.g., what improves more the environment? If I have to choose: should I
buy less flight tickets or consume less energy?)!
</p>

<p>
Following the Lisp principle that everything is data (lol, <a href="https://day8.github.io/re-frame/re-frame/">the author
of the guide of re-frame is really into this by the way</a>), how can I
"give life to my data"? How can I actually interact with it in a novel
way?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org63fb92a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org63fb92a">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org63fb92a">
<p>
Programs are data. The world has data everywhere! If we make our tools
better at extract useful meaning from that, well, we got more chance
to change things for the better. When somebody tells a lie, it is hard
to read all we need to find out the truth.
</p>

<p>
When we lie to ourselves is even harder! Say that I take notes with
Org Roam and I convinced myself that my main interest is Emacs. Could
I check my assumption according to my note database?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgce30e54" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgce30e54">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgce30e54">
<p>
Let's try to do just that (or an example of that at least)! The
question is: what notes attract my attention most? Let me quantify
this question by saying: which notes have the most Org Roam backlinks?
This makes sense to me because adding a backlink is an effort.
Backlinks show how much I care about a note. So the plan is to take (a
portion of -- I got too many notes--) my notes, get how many backlinks
they have, and plot this to see which note wins. Also I want to click
the plot to open the note in Emacs (and show its backlinks). It sounds
complex, but here it is!

  </video>
</p>

<p>
Time to explain! First of all the tools I needed for this workflow.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> (for everything really),</li>
<li><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org Roam</a> (for the notes),</li>
<li><a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a> (for the plot),</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">Moldable Emacs</a> (for playground and data conversion),</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ag91/emacs-with-nyxt">Emacs-with-Nyxt</a> (for interaction between Nyxt and Emacs),</li>
<li><a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/">Nyxt</a> (for hooking Emacs to the plot).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We start from a moldable-emacs Playground that takes the first 100
notes and transforms them into a plist. The list contains the number
of backlinks, the size of the file and a <code>:command</code> which tells what
to do when you click on a Vega-Lite node.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(--&gt; (org-roam-node-list)
     (-take 100 it)
     (--filter (&gt; (length (org-roam-backlinks-get it)) 0) it)
     (--map
      (list :file (org-roam-node-file it)
            :backlinks (length (org-roam-backlinks-get it))
            :size (file-attribute-size (file-attributes (org-roam-node-file it)))
            :command (concat "file:///"
                             (base64-encode-string
                              (concat
                               "(progn (find-file \""
                               (org-roam-node-file it)
                               "\")
                               (org-roam-buffer-toggle))"))
                             ".ag91"))
      it)
     )
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Vega-Lite does take data in JSON format. So we translate that plist
into JSON with another moldable-emacs mold. The Vega-Lite schema is a
hack of the <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/point_href.html">scatterplot with href</a> example. The dimensions I consider
are backlinks and size of file (I was curious if there was correlation
between size and backlinks).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, we now get into the pretty cool stuff. Vega-Lite supports
hyperlinks to allow you click a node of the plot and navigate the web.
I want to run an Emacs action instead (i.e., open the note and open
the Org Roam buffer with backlinks)! What to do? Hack the hyperlink!
</p>

<p>
Nyxt comes with a super-cool feature: it lets you define how to handle
links. <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1634#issuecomment-884831413">Recently I modified my Nyxt configuration to open mails with
Emacs</a>. You can also tell how to handle file extensions of an hyperlnk.
So I made my own file extension and an handler.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(define-configuration buffer
  ((request-resource-hook (reduce #'hooks:add-hook
                                  (list
                                        (url-dispatching-handler
                                         'emacs-mail
                                         (match-scheme "mailto")
                                         "/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval '(browse-url-mail \"~a\")'"
                                         )
                                        (url-dispatching-handler
                                         'decode-elisp-with-emacs
                                         (match-file-extension "ag91")
                                         "/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval '(emacs-with-nyxt-decode-command \"~a\")'"
                                         ))
                                  :initial-value %slot-default%))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that when I find that extension, I make Emacs call
<code>emacs-with-nyxt-decode-command</code>. The reason is into the Playground we saw before.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">:command (concat "file:///"
                             (base64-encode-string
                              (concat
                               "(progn (find-file \""
                               (org-roam-node-file it)
                               "\")
                               (org-roam-buffer-toggle))"))
                             ".ag91")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I put Elisp into my file name!!! I encode my Elisp program in base64
and then add an <code>.ag91</code> exention.
</p>

<p>
That is why I need a decode function.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emacs-with-nyxt-decode-command (a)
  (--&gt; a
       (s-split "/" it t)
       reverse
       car
       (s-split "\\." it t)
       car
       base64-decode-string
       read
       eval))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is probably crazy, but it opens humongous possibilities! You can
run Elisp from the browser. And you can embed actions as hyperlinks!! I
need to design a less hacky way to use this, after which I will add it
to moldable-emacs and emacs-with-nyxt.
</p>

<p>
And with this, I feel closer to have a moldable interface to
understand better the world around me.
</p>

<p>
(Note, this integration is a bit complex because Emacs does not have a
good UX story. Otherwise, we could probably have an Emacs Vega-Lite
and a simple way to hook actions to nodes. Nyxt embraces HTML and
makes that first class. I think <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">GlamorousToolkit</a> has a much better
story because the UX is a first class citizen of the IDE: this means I
would not need to jump from Emacs to Nyxt and back. In GT you can just
program the components of the UX (which are Pharo objects) from within
your tool. I hope Emacs will get inspired by that at some point!)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org79f08aa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org79f08aa">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org79f08aa">
<p>
So stay tuned! We are finally getting towards giving a UX to data
handled by Emacs. This is just a first experiment. Soon to come a
designed way to do this kind of things (at least the file extension
mechanism and encoding need to be easier).
</p>

<p>
Happy vega-liting!
