You can transform code with a Playground. As an example we will change
my blog CSS file!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org10274f3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org10274f3">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org10274f3">
<p>
I always considered code transformations magical. I still remember how
mind blowing was to realize that people have different ways to see the
same thing. When I actually can see code change shape to fit those
expectations: wow! It is just seeing other people ideas! Maybe this is
too abstract. In my last job my team members liked code to be tidy. I
think I am a tidy person, but I just got used to a different kind of
tidiness during my Ph.D. Let me show an example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala">def publicFn(): Int = privatePlus(1,1)

def privatePlus(a: Int, b: Int) =&gt; Int = a + b
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is what they liked: private functions at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
I would naturally write this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala">def privatePlus(a: Int, b: Int) =&gt; Int = a + b

def publicFn(): Int = privatePlus(1,1)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
(I guess my theorem proving practice has bent my brain: write small
facts and compose them to prove bigger facts.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, after convincing myself to rewrite my code a few times, I
thought: "Why am I wasting my time?". You could say team's peace of
mind, consistency, etc... But that is not the point! A machine can do
that much better than me. Code transformation here we go!
</p>

<p>
How is it possible that I have still to sort my functions by hand in 2021?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org29a89e6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org29a89e6">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org29a89e6">
<p>
That is just the start: why do we still spend precious time in
restructuring things? I propose that we should make it easy to say how
we like things and let the machine do it for us. For example, what if
we could say: "Mmm, enough of monolithic applications! Computer split
this application into modules like so and so". Sure describing the "so
and so" is not banal. But in big teams (i.e., n &gt;= 3), you will need
to explain that "so and so" anyway. Maybe somebody will be half asleep
that day (because, you know, life) and miss something. Even if they
were all awake, they still would have to apply your "so and so".
</p>

<p>
Do you see? Is not better to describe (i.e., program) things once?
</p>

<p>
And how could we do this in Emacs?!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org115351a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org115351a">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org115351a">
<p>
As usual we need to start small. We will change my blog CSS to
demonstrate how to save time with code transformations. I heard that
my blog style needs to improve. So say I want to change all my font
sizes and invert my colors. This sounds a long boring job, doesn't it?
</p>

<p>
Well, code transformation remember? We can open any CSS file with the
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a> code tree mold. This means that we can at least gather
those font sizes and colors I need to change. All you need to do is to
open a Playground and query things with the following code.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(--&gt;  (me/by-type 'integer_value self)
      (--filter (s-contains-p "px" (plist-get it :text)) it))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This picks all the CSS integer values. I filter the ones that are
pixels. Now say I want to change all the values in my file from pixels
to the <code>em</code> unit of measurement. The change description looks like this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(--&gt;  (me/by-type 'integer_value self)
      (--filter (s-contains-p "px" (plist-get it :text)) it)
      (--map (list
              :before it
              :after (plist-put
                      (copy-list it)
                      :text
                      (--&gt; (plist-get it :text)
                           (s-replace "px" "" it)
                           string-to-number
                           (/ it 16.0)
                           number-to-string
                           (concat it "em"))))
             it)
      me/change-nodes
      )
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As you can see, I map the list of pixel nodes to new nodes. So I
declare a <i>transition</i>, a <code>:before</code> node and an <code>:after</code>. Then I run
the transitions with <code>me/change-nodes</code>. (The translation to <code>em</code> is
just dividing the pixel by 16 in my case and replacing <code>px</code> with
<code>em</code>.)
</p>

<p>
And let's change colors too! I want to make the code blocks from a
dark background to a light one. So I think that inverting the colors
will bring me there.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(--&gt;  (me/by-type 'color_value self)
      (me/transitate-node-texts it
                                (lambda (content)
                                  (--&gt; content
                                       (color-complement it)
                                       (apply #'color-rgb-to-hex (-concat it (list 2))))))
      me/change-nodes)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
See how easy is to collect colors with Treesitter CSS grammar
identifier <code>color_value</code>. Also, I just came up with
<code>me/transitate-node-texts</code> to hide the <code>--map</code> I showed before. The
transformation is using the fabulous features of Emacs' color.el. The
<code>color-complement</code> function find the reverse of a color. Then I
transform that in a short RGB hex string (that is what <code>(list 2)</code> is
for in there).
</p>

<p>
Now how cool is to do this? Let me show it to you!
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/08/11/moldable-emacs-editing-your-file-via-treesitter-(or-how-i-fixed-my-css-with-a-playground)/playgroundCodeTransform.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/08/11/moldable-emacs-editing-your-file-via-treesitter-(or-how-i-fixed-my-css-with-a-playground)/playgroundCodeTransform.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
Immediate! No boring searching for each color inverse. A few lines and
zap! At least is a more interesting task!
</p>

<p>
And that is just a basic example. Imagine if you can change the code
to tell a story! What if you could run a migration from an
architecture to another by defining some rules like the ones I have
shown? One abstraction at the time and that could become possible (I hope)!
</p>

<p>
Let's see where we get to ;)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0ec9ee0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0ec9ee0">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ec9ee0">
<p>
If you have little boring tasks (or you really don't care about code
organization), well transform your code! As you could see, there is
already basic support in <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a>. Just grab a copy and give a
try. Hopefully it will save you time and bring some fun!
</p>

<p>
Happy transforming!
