<h2 id="orgbfe601e">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbfe601e">
<p>
The person behind the GitHub user ikappaki gave me a wonderful gift:
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/pull/16">they enabled CI for moldable-emacs</a>. I am grateful for that kindness. I
find Continous Integration vital for projects. My moldable-emacs
started as a prototype to see how many <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/docs/moldable/">moldable ideas</a> could fit in
Emacs. Learning how to setup CI for a (possibly-failing) prototype was
a bit out of scope at the time. At this point, though, it is <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/issues/24">very</a> <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/issues/23">much</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/issues/14">needed</a>! Now a change here causes an error there. Not good!
</p>

<p>
That's why ikappaki saved the day! We now have CI and we can test
things with <a href="https://github.com/doublep/eldev">eldev</a> and ERT, the Emacs' regression testing library.
</p>

<p>
We have <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/blob/ecaa723bed403855c5307a071decf4971bea1c9f/tests/moldable-emacs-test.el">few tests for now</a> and... I hope it stays that way!
</p>

<p>
The core issue is how to test molds. I hope to check that molds are
healthy without writing a test for each of them. Tests are code and
need maintenance too (and I want to save my time)!
</p>

<p>
How to achieve that?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2bbc4e1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2bbc4e1">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2bbc4e1">
<p>
This is a problem that I would like to solve in other places too. When
I program, I have a problem. I think about how to solve it. I write a
function. Then I write a test to avoid regressions (if I am TDDing, I
write the test to describe the problem). And then? Then time passes
and my completion framework shows me this function. But I don't
remember how to use it! So I need to hope I added docs or a test at
the time (assume the test passes) or worse read the function's code.
</p>

<p>
This seems a waste of time! If I have the test, I defined an example
of usage there. Why cannot I make that part of the function itself?
That way I could check if the function applies to the specific problem
I have by seeing the use case it was written for. Even when you have
static types, an example still helps!
</p>

<p>
AND with examples I could also test the function without writing a
test! I would just need to write the example WITH the function.
</p>

<p>
This would also make my completion more helpful! I could see an
example of usage (maybe even run it live) to pick the best fit while I
am developing.
</p>

<p>
Can we try this approach in moldable-emacs?

<h2 id="org08ad2ee">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08ad2ee">
<p>
Even if I didn't setup CI, <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/06/18/moldable-emacs-vision-basic-concepts-and-design/">I gave this problem a thought from the
start</a> (lucky me)! It is just merit of the amazing GlamorousToolkit's
community really: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwdJvgdbLPo?list=PLfrs5bwLJOoBtfhXJ4mqcQ4ktpQOEBTvP&amp;t=3245">you can watch Tudor Girba explaining how the idea
works in GT</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is how a mold looks in Elisp.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(me-register-mold
 :key "Playground"
 :given (:fn 't)
 :then (:fn
        ...)
 :examples ((
             :name "Empty file"
             :given (:type file :name "/tmp/test.txt" :mode text-mode :contents "")
             :then (:type buffer :name "Playground" :mode emacs-lisp-mode :contents ";; Tips:
;;    Use `self' to access the mold context.
;;    You can access the previous mold context through `mold-data'.

"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you see a mold as a function (<a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/issues/27">there is also a cool discussion
ongoing</a>), then the <code>:examples</code> bit is what I described earlier. That
is our example of usage!
</p>

<p>
The examples have 3 properties: a name, a given clause and a then
clause. That gives us enough information to show a demo to users. You
just have to call <code>me-mold-docs</code> and choose "Playground" to see a
documentation buffer using the example. It shows the following text:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">You can write any Elisp here.
Then you can evaluate with `EvalSexp'.
This mold saves structured data of the previous buffer
in the local variable `self'.

Given the "/tmp/test.txt" file with the following contents:

----------



----------

The mold returns the "Playground" buffer with the following contents:

----------

;; Tips:
;;    Use `self' to access the mold context.
;;    You can access the previous mold context through `mold-data'.



----------
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you use the mold "AllMolds" (<a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs/pull/22">thanks to alanz</a>) or
"WhatMoldsCanIuse?", you can even see the example as a demo of the
mold.
</p>

<p>
So with examples we get both documentation and preview. I want to
experiment with showing the preview when you pick a mold to use with
<code>me-mold</code>. That would cover the completion issue I mentioned before.
</p>

<p>
The properties of an example provide enough context for testing as
well. We could show a demo by setting buffers with name, contents and
mode as defined in the <code>:given</code> clause. Now we can setup a test with
the same information. The demo only creates mock buffers. The test
should set the precondition (the example <code>:given</code>) and then run the
mold starting from that. If the output is the same as the example
<code>:then</code> clause, the test passes.
</p>

<p>
The code for that is a bit ugly at the moment, but it works!
The following code is an example of a successful run.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(me-check-mold-examples (me-find-mold "Playground"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
While the following is an example of failure.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(me-check-mold-examples (me-find-mold "Evaluate Arithmetic Expression"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By the way, the above shows that the infrastructure is a prototype.
Some molds expect to set the point in a certain position and I cannot
express that yet in the example's <code>:given</code> clause.
</p>

<p>
Assuming I can come up with a better infra, I expect to add a single
test to the ERT suite. It will go through all the molds with examples
and run its examples as tests. This means that I will run tens of
tests in a few lines of code! And even if you think that the examples
are code themselves, well I can at least use them also for demos and
documentation. 3 in 1: what a deal! Better than just tests.
</p>

<p>
Also, examples need to be easy to add, right? The way I do it in
moldable-emacs is to run a mold, and then call
<code>me-insert-last-example</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note: this inserts the example wherever you are and it also misses the
<code>:name</code>! For now, you should go to the <code>:examples</code> section of the mold
and put your cursor in the first element of the list. And add a name.
I will make this even more user friendly soon (by asking the name and
inserting the example in the right place), but it already saves you
from adding <code>:given</code> and <code>:then</code> yourself!
</p>

<p>
This means that you can capture examples while you use molds! How cool
is it when machines can do most of the work?!
</p>

<p>
(Caveat: it is still a work in progress, things will not work for
molds that expect images or certain states of your machine -- like
files to be present)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc1f660b">
<p>
Make more out of examples! Look into how to make the examples in your
tests more useful. And if you use moldable-emacs, add examples to your
molds. If you do, you get free docs, demos and even tests!!!
