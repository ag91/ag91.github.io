<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: find hotspots in micro-services!</h1>
<div id="outline-container-org40df181" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org40df181">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org40df181">
<p>
Do you work with micro-services? You can now compare their hotspots!
Just run <code>c/show-hotspot-cluster</code> in a directory containing them. You
will obtain a single hotspot graph.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org522b343" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org522b343">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org522b343">
<p>
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/">We saw already that hotspots can bring us to code with problems</a>. You
can run code-compass' <code>c/show-hotspots</code> on any Git project. It may
happen, though, that you have to put your architect hat on and look at
an orchestration. In that case you may want to compare hotspots of
multiple projects. For example, this applies to micro-services. You
have a number of projects that collaborate to bring value. Often many
teams maintain them. And some teams follow great coding practices and
others follow some poorer ones. It could be useful to compare these
projects to spot problems early.
</p>

<p>
Our hotspots analysis would be great for that, but it takes only one
repository! What to do?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2965910" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2965910">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2965910">
<p>
We can extend it! The idea is to loop over the repositories and
accumulate one big analyses. The implementation is a bit hacky, but
check out how it looks.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/04/08/emacs-as-your-code-compass-find-hotspots-in-micro-services/code-compass-cluster.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/04/08/emacs-as-your-code-compass-find-hotspots-in-micro-services/code-compass-cluster.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
I just run <code>c/show-hotspot-cluster</code> and pick a directory containing
repositories. I pick a starting date for the analysis. After waiting a
little, I get a hotspot analysis that contains all the repositories.
You can see that I can now compare the size of the projects. And I can
see the modules that are most exercised.
</p>

<p>
Again this is incredible useful to keep track of what is going on in
the overall code base.
</p>

<p>
Also often projects share the same structure. For example, projects
following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Driven_Design">Domain Driven Design</a> will have a domain and an adapter
directory. If your project follows a standard, you may discover
hotspots in a directory that is common to many projects. That could be
a sign that many teams are working independently on the same changes.
You could use this insight to get in touch with other teams and join
efforts.
</p>

<p>
All in all, this is also useful for comparing projects design. I could
find out in one gaze that some projects had too much functionality
compared to others. That is a good call to action to reshuffle
responsibilities around, and keep things small.
</p>

<p>
Note that you can also specify a <code>repos-cluster.txt</code> file in the
directory with your projects. If you list the names of the projects in
there, <code>c/show-hotspot-cluster</code> will pick only those. This is handy if
you keep all your projects in a single directory.
</p>

<h2 id="org0ef89bb">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ef89bb">
<p>
This is it! You will be able to see micro-services and compare
components. Just run <code>c/show-hotspot-cluster</code> on the container
directory and you will get your comprehensive view.
</p>

<p>
Happy comprehension!
