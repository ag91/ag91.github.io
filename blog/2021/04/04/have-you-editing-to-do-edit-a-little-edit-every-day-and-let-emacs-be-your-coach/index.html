<h1>Have you editing to do? Edit a little, edit every day, and let Emacs be your coach!</h1>

Do you need to edit a piece of text that is hard to read? Have you to
write something and you are afraid it will turn ugly?
Writer-word-goals (wwg) now helps you making text more readable.

<h2 id="org54291fe">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org54291fe">
<p>
Writing is hard. You try to share your ideas in a way that others can
understand. Every time I write something though, I get carried away.
The more I write, the more complicated it gets. The more complicated,
the less readable. At the end of my writing session (after the 1k
words <a href="https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals">wwg</a> pushes me to write), I have some ideas written down. And I
have also some new edits to do. For that I will read and reread until it feels right. That is not great, because I cannot track my progress.
</p>

<p>
The question is: can my editor help me with that?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd45d0e6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd45d0e6">It is a problem indeed</h2>

It is funny, because this do&amp;review is a pattern. In software you may
get carried away by the code, and forget users' needs. Designers
follow the beauty of their products and forget to make them easy to
use. Even architects put the look of houses before how livable they
are. (<a href="file:///home/andrea/workspace/agenda/notes/20200822224243-stewart_brand.html">Stewart Brand</a> tells a lot about architects in his book
<a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/38310.How_Buildings_Learn?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=DIwvC7gEFg&amp;amp;rank=1">How Buildings Learn</a>.)
</p>

<p>
It seems that we put aside the central features in favour of minor ones.
</p>

<p>
I think our tools can help us reminding ourselves what we are doing
things for.
</p>

<p>
How cool would be if I can see readability
while I write? I would like to see in one gaze that the following two
sentences are more and less accessible.
</p>

<p>
An incredible amount of time of ours is spent in less relevant efforts.
Really, we waste too much time in details.
</p>

<p>
If I could see that the first is less readable, I could change it when
I have fresh in my mind what I wanted to express.
</p>

<p>
Would this be even possible?
