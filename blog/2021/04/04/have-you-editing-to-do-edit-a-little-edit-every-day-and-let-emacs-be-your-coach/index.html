<h2 id="org930fbdf">Too long; didn't read</h2>

Do you need to edit a piece of text that is hard to read? Have you to
write something and you are afraid it will turn ugly?
Writer-word-goals (wwg) now helps you making text more readable.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org17d8643" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org17d8643">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org17d8643">
<p>
Writing is hard. You try to share your ideas in a way that others can
understand. Every time I write something though, I get carried away.
The more I write, the more complicated it gets. The more complicated,
the less readable. At the end of my writing session (after the 1k
words <a href="https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals">wwg</a> pushes me to write), I have some ideas written down. And I
have also some new edits to do. For that I will read and reread until it feels right. That is not great, because I cannot track my progress.
</p>

<p>
The question is: can my editor help me with that?
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org56517bc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org56517bc">It is a problem indeed</h2>

<p>
It is funny, because this do&amp;review is a pattern. In software you may
get carried away by the code, and forget users' needs. Designers
follow the beauty of their products and forget to make them easy to
use. Even architects put the look of houses before how livable they
are. (<a href="file:///home/andrea/workspace/agenda/notes/20200822224243-stewart_brand.html">Stewart Brand</a> tells a lot about architects in his book
<a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/38310.How_Buildings_Learn?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=DIwvC7gEFg&amp;amp;rank=1">How Buildings Learn</a>.)
</p>

<p>
It seems that we put aside the central features in favour of minor ones.
</p>

<p>
I think our tools can help us reminding ourselves what we are doing
things for.
</p>

<p>
How cool would be if I can see readability
while I write? I would like to see in one gaze that the following two
sentences are more and less accessible.
</p>

<p>
An incredible amount of time of ours is spent in less relevant efforts.
Really, we waste too much time in details.
</p>

<p>
If I could see that the first is less readable, I could change it when
I have fresh in my mind what I wanted to express.
</p>

<p>
Would this be even possible?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgeab6299" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgeab6299">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeab6299">
<p>
It is possible! I tested this myself "on the road". <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/forensic-testing-uncovering-quality-issues-using-your-organization-s-code-repository">I wrote an article
and got it published</a>. This was my first writing gig. I used <code>wwg</code> to
write the contents and I submitted. They aim for great content, so an
editor checked my work. She reviewed, adjusted and asked me to clarify
certain parts. At this point I had already wwg working for editing. So
I rewrote the unclear bits while "seeing readability". She accepted
them! No comment was surely a good sign. Now, I thought, I may be
onto something.
</p>

<p>
So what did I do? I had already worked on something that did not
lead me far. I am a happy user of <a href="https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode/pull/27">writegood-mode</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode/pull/27">Some time ago I proposed an on-the-fly readablity score</a>. The problem
with that is it displays you the score while you write. Again: or you
write or you read. Doing both is hard. As hard as writing and editing
at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The scoring comes from writegood-mode. The mode uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability</a> tests. In essence we score sentences
according to how long are the words and the sentence that contains them.
The algorithm is simple. For that reason it does not work in all
cases. But in most ones it does magic!
</p>

<p>
Note they made this score for English. In other languages the score my change.
</p>

<p>
Let me show how it looks like!
</p>


<div id="orge12a2c2" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/04/04/have-you-editing-to-do-edit-a-little-edit-every-day-and-let-emacs-be-your-coach/screen.jpg" alt="screen.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The green lines are easy. The yellow a little bit difficult. You want
really to fix the red ones. In the example you can see all of those.
Note how the red one contains a link. As I mentioned, the algorithm is
simple, so false-positive are likely. So use this mode with a critical
approach, not blind faith.
</p>

<p>
The view is available in two flavours: scoring by sentence
(<code>wwg-score-sentences-mode</code>) and paragraph
(<code>wwg-score-paragraphs-mode</code>). You may want a paragraph view
for longer pieces of text.
</p>


<p>
Now comes the pretty cool bit. If we can quantify how easy a text is
to read, we can also set <b>goals</b>!
</p>

<p>
Imagine you get this long piece of text to edit. You can now say: "I
want to make this at least 20% easier to read". Then you "see
readability" and choose the part of text to edit.
</p>

<p>
Now you can start this editing session with <code>wwg-editing-mode</code>. It
does exactly that. It asks you to choose between three levels of
editing: Easy, Medium or Hard. Then similarly to <code>wwg-mode</code>, it tries
to keep up your morale by complimenting your progress. When you finish
it, your text is easier to read!
</p>

<p>
Note: the highlighting may have some hiccups if the first sentence in
the file does not end by a dot. I am going to patch this as soon as I
have some time (I also accept PRs!!). I thought to share it early
because it is too cool to keep it all for myself!
