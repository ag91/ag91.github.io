<h1>Moldable Emacs: extending the Playground powers via hooks (to include Dired)</h1>
<div id="outline-container-orgdb213f4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdb213f4">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb213f4">

The Playground is at its best when a <code>self</code> variable is defined. Molds always
define such a variable, but you can define one even for normal buffer.
Here I show how to do that for Dired buffers.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfcb9508" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfcb9508">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfcb9508">
<p>
It happened again! I was in a Dired buffer, I selected some files, and
I thought: "how cool would it be to find out how complex these files
are?". And once more I scratched my head and let my thoughts pass by:
too difficult! Sometimes I need just a simple mechanism to run an
Elisp snippet through files I selected in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">Dired</a>. I know I could use
eshell, or first collect the files in a list and then write an Elisp
snippet. But now that I use <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a>'s Playground, I really
would like to do that more easily!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1b7f850" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1b7f850">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1b7f850">
<p>
Well, Dired fantastic capabilities are only a part of the story. Loop
a snippet through files selected with Dired is cool, but I expect to
have similar use cases for other existing Emacs modes. For example, I
expect to want to script my way through a list of commits selected in
<a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>. Or a list of snippets selected in grep-mode!
</p>

<p>
The molds of moldable-emacs set a variable named <code>self</code> to contain the
useful contents of a buffer. The idea is to make easy for other molds
(Playground <i>in primis</i>) to transform those contents. The issue is
that <code>self</code> is only set by molds! Dired does not set that. So if I
open a Playground from a Dired buffer, I have no <code>self</code>.
</p>

<p>
How could we set <code>self</code> for buffers of other amazing modes?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf52ff60" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf52ff60">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf52ff60">
<p>
This took much more thought than needed. The other evening I realized
I had all the pieces I needed to make that happen.
</p>

<p>
Let me show the result first!
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/09/23/moldable-emacs-extending-the-playground-powers-via-hooks-to-include-dired/diredPlayground.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/09/23/moldable-emacs-extending-the-playground-powers-via-hooks-to-include-dired/diredPlayground.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
This is just magic! I mark some (<a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/">Nyxt</a> source) files in Dired, then I
carry the files in a Playground. Next I use my fabulous <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>
complexity analysis on their contents. I can produce an alist or even
better a plist. And as you know, I can make an Org table from that and
plot the results!
</p>

<p>
The beauty of this system is that I can compose at will. And when I am
not sure how to compose, I have just to invoke <code>me-mold</code>. That will
suggest me working molds to use next! For example, I could have used
also the line plot! (Vega-Lite is still in the works by the way!)
</p>

<p>
You can see how simple is the code in the Playground.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(--map
 (cons `(file . ,it)
       (c/calculate-complexity-stats (with-file it (buffer-string))))
 self)

(--&gt; (--map
      (cons `(file . ,it)
            (c/calculate-complexity-stats (with-file it (buffer-string))))
      self)
     (--map (list :file (alist-get 'file it)
                  :complexity (alist-get 'total it))
            it))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Dired is doing the hard work of letting me select files! Indeed, my
aim is to leverage amazing software and integrating it with our newer
system. I guess this is going towards software environmentalism <a href="https://youtu.be/SflvfvOQ_5k?t=905">in the
words of Tudor Girba</a>: we reuse the brightness of our predecessors. (And
what a view from these giants shoulders!)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you wish, you can extend the Playground too. The trick for
Dired is in the following code.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun me/set-dired-self-for-playground ()
  "Set Playground `self' to dired list of files."
  (when (and
         (equal me/last-used-mold "Playground")
         (ignore-errors mold-data)
         (eq (plist-get mold-data :old-mode) 'dired-mode))
    (setq-local self (with-current-buffer (plist-get mold-data :old-buffer)
                       (or (progn (goto-char (point-min)) (dired-get-marked-files))
                           (progn (mark-whole-buffer)
                                  (call-interactively #'dired-mark)
                                  (let ((files (dired-get-marked-files)))
                                    (call-interactively #'dired-unmark-all-files)
                                    files)))))))
(add-hook 'me/mold-after-hook #'me/set-dired-self-for-playground) ;; the order is important: keep before me/set-self-mold-data
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In short this code runs after a mold has run (i.e.,
<code>me/mold-after-hook</code>). If the mold was a Playground and the starting
buffer was a Dired one, we set <code>self</code>. In this case, I exploit
<code>dired-get-marked-files</code> to get the list of file names. Note that
<code>mold-data</code> is also set via a hook. That is why I got the comment at
the end: this must run after that data is set otherwise it would not
work.
</p>

<p>
That is all! If you need to extend moldable-emacs's interpreter you
have <code>me/mold-after-hook</code> and <code>me/mold-before-hook</code> and even
<code>me/mold-before-mold-runs-hook</code>. So you are free to make <code>me/mold</code>
smarter!

<p>
Let's jump on the shoulders of Emacs giants! By extending the
Playground we acquire incredible superpowers, because we can make
existing modes behave like molds. So grab a copy of moldable-emacs and
start scripting your marked files away!

<p>
Happy Dired-ing!
