<h1>Moldable Emacs: vision, basic concepts and design</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org33035da" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org33035da">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org33035da">
<p>
This is the vision statement of my efforts to make Emacs a moldable
environment. I share the design ideas guiding me. Also a bit of code
to have a glimpse of what I got so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgee313b5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgee313b5">The vision</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgee313b5">
<p>
The ambition is to make Emacs a moldable environment. My guide is the
vision behind <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">GlamorousToolkit</a>: we want to handle our system
complexity by letting the system explain itself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klTjiXjqHrQ">Bret Victor makes the
rationale for this clear</a>: today we can achieve marvellous things by
trial and error, but we lack the tools to understand in depth the
things we created. We create a thing, then time passes and somebody
else (even us!) has no clue how the thing we created works. This same
destiny will befall upon your smartphone and your bank's "ancient"
COBOL system.
</p>

<p>
The turning point is to create a system to explain systems. This must
explain itself to the user.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has good roots because its creators were wise to require to
provide self documentation. That is only part of it though. For
example, GlamorousToolkit focuses on telling stories, because that is
the way people understand the world around them. This is why you will
see a lot of given-when-then notation in the current implementation of
the <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a> mode: I want to give Emacs a story telling spin.
</p>

<p>
So again, our system needs to be able to explain systems. The
explanation changes according to the context. This means that our
system needs to be malleable. It must allow to tell the same story in
the best way for the system at hand. For instance, we need different
ways to explain how software like Pandoc, Org Mode or Datomic work.
And we would need different ways for each of these if the audience
changes.
</p>

<p>
This is why we will work with views: we have some structured text and
we want to produce quickly the best view to extract meaning from that.
The meaning depends on what we are looking for. That also changes, so
we need highly customizable views. We need to make up views on the
fly!
</p>

<p>
Our Emacs extension must let us explain the system at hand. The
explanation we come up with should ease us in understanding the part
of the system we care about at this moment. Our mode needs to
facilitate this so that we spend minimal effort in automating the
explanation.
</p>

<p>
Essentially the vision of this mode is to make you a better story
teller. I aim to make you (and myself) focus on making better tools to
explain the systems we create or stumbled into. That way we will
surely make it easier for ourselves and our future generations to
understand what great and useful things we made.
</p>

<h2 id="org3b0deba">The design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b0deba">
<p>
The whole extension I am proposing revolves around the concept of
views. In this mode I call views "molds". I made this up inspired by
moldable development. Molds let you take a buffer (data) and transform
it into another buffer (other data). For example, I want to transform
an Org Mode buffer into a buffer containing its first Org table. The
story for this mold is as simple as: "given a document, then I want to
focus on the first table". Again a mold takes a buffer and produces
another buffer. We define how to transform things via Elisp. This is
important because we can change Emacs with it. Changing Emacs you can
change our extension. This makes our system fractal and powerful.
</p>

<p>
There is more. Bret Victor's has great ideas on how to define a
programming environment:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>read the vocabulary</li>
<li>follow the flow</li>
<li>see the state</li>
<li>create by reacting</li>
<li>start concrete (abstraction)</li>
</ol>

<p>
And a programming language:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>identity and metaphor (to understand environment concepts by similitude)</li>
<li>decomposition</li>
<li>recomposition</li>
<li>readability (explaining the vocabulary)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I tried to give an answer to these in my extension (I am a novice of
these ideas, so don't tell Bret Victor what I am doing otherwise <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">I may
end up being told off as Khan Academy</a>). (By the way, learning from
GlamorousToolkit and playing with Bret Victor's ideas made me pretty
excited about this side project.)
</p>

<p>
"Read the vocabulary" is about the system's self explanation, so we
will need a mold that explains how <a href="https://github.com/ag91/moldable-emacs">moldable-emacs</a> works. Since all
code of moldable-emacs shows in buffers, we can make a mold for
that.
</p>

<p>
"Follow the flow" is about knowing what is happening while you are
using the system. Any mold you run has a before and after buffer, and
I already made some utility to navigate this history. You could even
make a mold to make the history easy to observe (and replay?).
</p>

<p>
"See the state" is about knowing what our system is doing. You can
think of debugging here, where you can peek into the variables that
your program is using. The fun fact is that I am following a pretty
functional (as in programming) approach. You could have a mold that
shows the parameters used by the mold you are using!
</p>

<p>
"Create by reacting" is about starting making something cool by just
some initial scratches. Think of a story teller that sees a cloud in
the sky and starts building up a fabulous adventure from a shape she
saw. Using a mold should inspire the usage of more molds. By the way,
each mold checks that the context is right for its usage, so you
cannot go wrong with composition here. For example the mold that finds
the first table can run only in an Org Mode buffer that contains at
least a table. You cannot use it in all other cases.
</p>

<p>
"Start concrete" then generalize is about abstraction. Our system has
to ease the making of molds to the point that we can throw them away
without remorse. If we find out we keep creating the same
made-on-the-fly mold, we can register it and give it a name.
</p>

<p>
Although Bret Victor meant the next set of design principles for a
programming language, I will give it a go anyway!
</p>

<p>
"Identity and metaphor" is basically view information in a more
effective and resonating way for the context you come from: that is
just the aim of molds!
</p>

<p>
"Decomposition" is about breaking your thoughts in something
manageable. Making small on-the-fly molds, or having those already
available lets you formulate the story you want to tell in a flow.
</p>

<p>
"Recomposition" is about take those broken thoughts and compose them
in a coherent story. This principle inspired me to do something I am
happy with: I made an utility to compose molds from existing one and
naming them. This also inspired a way to both testing them,
checking their composability and documenting them!
</p>

<p>
"Readability" is about explaining what our system components are
about. In the context of our extension, each mold must come with at
least an example. This is the mechanism I mentioned above. An example
shows the before and after state of using a mold. It also helps as
documentation. You can form an idea of what a mold produces.
</p>

<p>
Likely all of this is a bit of a stretch of what Bret Victor meant,
but I still wanted to try merging his and moldable development ideas.
Adding examples to molds inspired me with many useful features. For
the records, I got the importance of examples from GlamorousToolkit:
<a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a>'s people changed unit tests to return the objects under tests
and use those as examples.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org428ba8f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org428ba8f">The current implementation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org428ba8f">
<p>
A mold looks like this in Elisp:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(
 :key "Playground"
 :given (lambda nil 't)
 :then (lambda nil (let (... ...) (with-current-buffer buffer ... ... ... buffer) buffer))
 :docs "You can write any Elisp here. 
Then you can evaluate with `EvalSexp'. 
This mold saves structured data of the previous buffer 
in the local variable `self'."
 :examples ((
             :name "Empty file"
             :given (:type file :name "/tmp/test.txt" :mode text-mode :contents "")
             :then (:type buffer :name ... :mode emacs-lisp-mode :contents ""))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A mold needs the following.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>a key</dt><dd>the unique name of the mold used to find it;</dd>
<dt>a given clause</dt><dd>this is a predicate for the preconditions needed for this mold;</dd>
<dt>a then clause</dt><dd>the transformation this mold will apply, this has to return a buffer;</dd>
<dt>some docs</dt><dd>a line to explain what this does;</dd>
<dt>some examples</dt><dd>this is a minimal usage of the mold, so users can have an idea of what it does.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Documentation and examples are optional because I am
designing/developing a way for making it trivial for the user to
provide these while using molds. Examples are fundamental to me
because they tell useful stories (and with those I can do very cool
things in terms of usability and validation).
</p>

<p>
The core of the mode is the function that uses this information to
execute molds: <code>me/mold</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun me/mold ()
  "Propose a list of available molds for the current context."
  (interactive)
  (run-hooks 'me/mold-before-hook)
  (let* ((molds (--filter
                 (funcall (plist-get it :given))
                 me/available-molds))
         (keys (--map (plist-get it :key) molds)))
    (--&gt; keys
      (completing-read
       "Pick the mold you need:"
       it)
      (-find
       (lambda (x)
         (string=
          (plist-get x :key)
          it))
       molds)
      (funcall
       (lambda (mold)
         (--each
             me/mold-before-mold-runs-hook
           (funcall it mold))
         mold)
       it)
      (plist-get it :then)
      funcall
      switch-to-buffer-other-window)
    (run-hooks 'me/mold-after-hook))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In short, this function does the following.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>find molds that satisfy your situation (the <code>:given</code></li>
</ol>
<p>
clause)
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>let you pick one of these</li>
<li>open the new buffer (generated with the <code>:then</code> clause) on the
side.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The hooks allow to integrate some extra functionality. For example I
currently support history to jump back and forth in the list of
generated buffers. I happen to get my molding wrong and I can quickly
return to the previous buffer to try again with a keybinding.
</p>

<p>
Last thing I want to mention here is that the current implementation
already supports composition with <code>me/mold-compose-molds</code>! 
</p>

<p>
For example, I have a mold to produce a graph from the first Org Table in the buffer.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(me/register-mold-by-key
 "FirstOrgTableToBarChart"
 (me/mold-compose
  (me/mold-compose "FirstOrgTable"  "OrgTableToCSV")
  "CSVToBarChart"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here I transform an Org Mode buffer to an Org Mode buffer with a
single table. Then the table to a CSV buffer. Then the CSV to a bar
chart. The function <code>me/mold-compose</code> composes existing molds by
looking for their key and feeding these to <code>me/mold-compose-molds</code>.
Then <code>me/register-mold-by-key</code> assigns a key to this composed mold and
adds it to the register. I may provide a macro soon to make
composition more readable.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="orga2b8616">Final thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga2b8616">
<p>
This is more or less a short summary of the core of what is letting
mold my software world (from Emacs).
</p>

<p>
I have already about 40ish molds that I found so valuable to add to my
mold register. I am still looking for a good story about mold
contribution: looking at how GlamorousToolkit is evolving I guess I
should provide a set of core molds (like Playground) and a set of
contributed ones. Some molds that would be cool to have are for
maneuvering external APIs (for example the one of <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>).
</p>

<p>
Something that also interests me is integrating Emacs and
GlamorousToolkit. Emacs currently focuses mostly on text and molds are
most powerful when you get useful information without reading. I
looked in the potential of widgets in Emacs, but it seems too
expensive for me. I would rather go towards integrating with external
tools for getting amazing visual features.
</p>

<p>
All in all, this mode is just exciting to develop! I feel a bit like a
bee that cross-pollinates ideas from various communities: I learn a
lot and hopefully I make something valuable for others in the process.
