<h1>Back to Emacs while in Nyxt: how to edit the web in a Lispy editor</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org916101f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org916101f">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org916101f">
<p>
Nyxt can call Emacs via <code>emacsclient</code>. Here we learn two things: how
to edit web forms with Emacs from Nyxt and how to write Nyxt commands
that run Emacs functions!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3c3460c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3c3460c">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3c3460c">
<p>
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/06/08/emacs-nyxt-and-engine-mode-how-to-browse-urls-via-nyxt-and-slime/">In an earlier post I have shown how to call Nyxt from Emacs</a>. In that
way you can explore the web via Nyxt, by simply telling Emacs: "open
this page with Nyxt". The main advantage is that exploring the web
(with full browser functionality) becomes part of your Emacs workflow.
</p>

<p>
A new problem arises once you are in Nyxt though. Say you have a form
on an HTML page. Then you remember that you have the perfect
skeleton/snippet in your Emacs for that.
</p>

<p>
How great would it be if you could use Emacs to fill that form,
instead of doing some copy-pasting?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc1d501f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc1d501f">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc1d501f">
<p>
Actually that is just the tip of the iceberg! What if we could start a
ping-pong between Emacs and Nyxt to complete our workflows? Let me
explain.
</p>

<p>
Say you have finished writing a blog post with Emacs, you publish it
locally and use Nyxt to read it. Then you find an error.
</p>

<p>
Would not be cool if with a keystroke you could open the source file
in Emacs? Once you fix the problem, you do another keystroke and you
are back in Nyxt at the point were you stopped before.
</p>

<p>
How far are we from achieving that?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd453087" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd453087">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd453087">
<p>
Let's start simple. Nyxt allows you to set an editor with which to
complete forms. This is how I configure Nyxt to achieve that.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(DEFINE-CONFIGURATION (BUFFER WEB-BUFFER)
  ((DEFAULT-MODES (APPEND '(EMACS-MODE) %SLOT-DEFAULT))))
(DEFINE-CONFIGURATION BROWSER
  ((EXTERNAL-EDITOR-PROGRAM "/usr/bin/emacsclient")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The first bit is about having Emacs keybindings in Nyxt. The second
expression sets <code>emacsclient</code> as the default external editor.
</p>

<p>
Add these lines in your auto-config path. That is located at
<code>~/.config/nyxt/auto-config.lisp</code> on Linux.
</p>

<p>
When you are on the input of a form, you just have to use <code>C-x '</code>
(like for Org Mode source blocks) and you will open Emacs. At that
point insert the text you need and use <code>C-x #</code>. You shall be back in
Nyxt.
</p>

<p>
A word of caution: <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/source/external-editor.lisp#L26">this works only for forms for now. Not sure why
this limitation</a>, I am eventually going to ask the devs. It would be
cool to have this for anything. Imagine if we could set also the
fittest Emacs mode (I am thinking of editing GitHub files online with
Emacs)!
</p>

<p>
Actually we may not even need the help of Nyxt devs for that! We can
change Nyxt at run time with Slime, remember?
</p>

<p>
For now let's go easy again. I assume you have Nyxt running. Also you
should have a nice Slime REPL available to edit it on the run.
</p>

<p>
Let's start from letting Nyxt speak to Emacs. Building over <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/emacs-hacks.org">Pierre
Neidhards' Emacs Hacks</a>, you can use the following.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(defun replace-all (string part replacement &amp;key (test #'char=))
  "Returns a new string in which all the occurences of the part 
is replaced with replacement."
  (with-output-to-string (out)
    (loop with part-length = (length part)
          for old-pos = 0 then (+ pos part-length)
          for pos = (search part string
                            :start2 old-pos
                            :test test)
          do (write-string string out
                           :start old-pos
                           :end (or pos (length string)))
          when pos do (write-string replacement out)
            while pos)))

(defun eval-in-emacs (&amp;rest s-exps)
  "Evaluate S-EXPS with emacsclient."
  (let ((s-exps-string (replace-all
                        (write-to-string
                         `(progn ,@s-exps) :case :downcase)
                        ;; Discard the package prefix.
                        "nyxt::" "")))
    (format *error-output* "Sending to Emacs:~%~a~%" s-exps-string)
    (uiop:run-program
     (list "emacsclient" "--eval" s-exps-string))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The function <code>eval-in-emacs</code> allows you to send Elisp code to
<code>emacsclient</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you managed to run that in your Slime, then try to run also this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(define-command my/playing-around ()
     "Query ."
     (eval-in-emacs
        `(message "hello from Nyxt!")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do that, you will find a new command in Nyxt! This will pop a
message in your Emacs!! Nyxt has just called Emacs: how cool are we?!?
</p>

<p>
Now let's try something fancier. What about jumping from a GitHub page
opened in Nyxt to our local source file and back?
</p>

<p>
Say I am on
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals/blob/master/wwg.el">https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals/blob/master/wwg.el</a> and I
want to visit a line of it in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
This is the function I need for Nyxt.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(define-command my/display-wwg-selection ()
     "Something else."
     (let ((selection (%copy)))
       (eval-in-emacs
        `(find-file "~/workspace/writer-word-goals/wwg.el")
        `(goto-char (point-min))
        `(search-forward ,selection))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now if I select some text in the page that belongs to the file, I will
open the file in Emacs at that point.
</p>

<p>
What about jumping back from Emacs to Nyxt then?
</p>

<p>
This was a bit tougher to make it work due to my Common Lisp basic
skills, but <a href="https://discourse.atlas.engineer/t/how-do-i-search-a-buffer-via-lisp/164">thanks to the amazing Atlas community I found out how</a>.
</p>

<p>
We need to search a Nyxt buffer. This is already possible, but only
via Nyxt's prompt. We need to do a search via CL: is the Nyxt so
programmable then?
</p>

<p>
The following is the CL code we need.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(nyxt/web-mode::highlight-selected-hint
 :link-hint
 (car
  (nyxt/web-mode::matches-from-json
   (nyxt/web-mode::query-buffer :query "someString")))
 :scroll 't)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These are a few lines of Common Lisp that highlight and scroll to the
first match over the query string. The function
<code>nyxt/web-mode::query-buffer</code> is finding all the matches. The function
<code>nyxt/web-mode::matches-from-json</code> converts matches to a Lisp format.
Finally, <code>highlight-selected-hint</code> is running some JavaScript
(compiled from <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/">ParensScript</a>!) to select the match on the page.
</p>

<p>
Using our <a href="https://github.com/ag91/emacs-with-nyxt">emacs-with-nyxt</a> infrastructure, we can get an Elisp function
for jumping back to Nyxt from Emacs.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun emacs-with-nyxt-search-first-in-nyxt-current-buffer (string)
  "Search current Nyxt buffer for STRING."
  (interactive "sString to search: ")
  (unless (slime-connected-p) (emacs-with-nyxt-start-and-connect-to-nyxt))
  (emacs-with-nyxt-slime-repl-send-string
   (format "(nyxt/web-mode::highlight-selected-hint :link-hint (car (nyxt/web-mode::matches-from-json (nyxt/web-mode::query-buffer :query \"%s\"))) :scroll 't)" string)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That was an example of what is achievable! I found this promising
given that I started using Nyxt a couple of weeks ago. And I am also
becoming familiar with Common Lisp!!!
</p>

This was our first ping-pong between Emacs and Nyxt! As you could see
the mix of these two tools has powerful potential. Give it a try and
let me know how it does feel for you!
