<h1>Find Org Roam notes via their relations</h1>
<div id="outline-container-org5c43024" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5c43024">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5c43024">
<p>
Are you an <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a> user that takes a lot of notes and struggles
finding them? I will share here a function to reach lost notes via
their relations.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orga059507" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga059507">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga059507">
<p>
I like to read. A lot. And for a while I struggled at remembering good
quotes and concepts that I read in books. Things somewhat improved
when I got my e-reader. I could easily annotate text and move my notes
around. Then I started using org-roam. With it I could organize my
notes and discover them easily via <code>org-roam-find-file</code>. And it
went like that for a while, until... there were too many notes around!
</p>

<p>
My first adjustment was using <code>org-roam-graph</code> (long are gone the
times when I could plot all of my notes with the default command).
With that you <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Graphing">can see notes as a navigable picture</a>. The best situation
to consult these graphs of notes is when your notes link to each
other, because they will be closer to each other.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, give it enough time and the value of your notes will not be
graphs but the links between different graphs. How can we explore
them?
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5a2cdbe" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5a2cdbe">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a2cdbe">
<p>
Luckily I am not the only one having this issue! Somebody <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server">developed a
nice visualization web application for your notes</a> (a serious upgrade
of <code>org-roam-graph</code>). Some other person <a href="https://github.com/publicimageltd/delve">has started ordering properly
notes via smart database queries</a>. And somebody else
<a href="https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/analysing-the-semantic-network/56">has
started analyzing relations between notes with statistics tools</a>!
</p>

<p>
I tried all of these, but again: I got too many notes now. And I want
a simple and quick tool to follow my note relations. So I spent some
time searching around with little success. Then I asked myself: how
difficult would it be to bake my own little function?
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org60742ea" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org60742ea">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org60742ea">
<p>
My ideal function follows org-roam notes relations as if they were
files in a file system. If a note does not have links, I can only open
it, otherwise I can both navigate its directly related notes or open it.
</p>

<p>
Well that is what I need in words. Let me show you what I got!
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/03/12/find-org-roam-notes-via-their-relations/orgRoamFindNote.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/03/12/find-org-roam-notes-via-their-relations/orgRoamFindNote.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
In the video I open my Tiramisu' recipe note. Then I follow its
relations and I get to a new recipe. The relation I am using for this
journey is "recipe". I use that as a linking note for my recipes.
</p>

<p>
The code for the function is below.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun my/navigate-note (arg &amp;optional note choices)
  "Navigate notes by link. With universal ARG tries to use only to navigate the tags of the current note. Optionally takes a selected NOTE and filepaths CHOICES."
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((choices (or
                   choices
                   (when arg (org-roam-db--links-with-max-distance (buffer-file-name) 1))))
         (all-notes (org-roam--get-title-path-completions))
         (completions
          (or (--filter (-contains-p choices (plist-get (cdr it) :path)) all-notes) all-notes))
         (title-with-tags (org-roam-completion--completing-read "File: " completions))
         (res (cdr (assoc title-with-tags completions)))
         (next-note (plist-get res :path)))
    (if (string= note next-note)
        (find-file note)
      (my/navigate-note nil next-note (org-roam-db--links-with-max-distance next-note 1)))))
</pre>
</div>

<b>Updated version for latest Org Roam v2.2.1</b>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun my/navigate-note (arg &amp;optional note choices)
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((completions (org-roam-node-read--completions))
         (next-note (if (and (null note) (org-roam-node-at-point))
                        (org-roam-node-title (org-roam-node-at-point))
                      (completing-read "File: " (or choices completions))))
         (candidates
          (--&gt; next-note
               (assoc it completions)
               cdr
               org-roam-backlinks-get
               (--map
                (org-roam-node-title
                 (org-roam-backlink-source-node it))
                it))))
    (if (string= note next-note)
        (org-roam-node-open (org-roam-node-from-title-or-alias note))
      (my/navigate-note nil next-note (or candidates (list next-note))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A recursive function! The design is: gather all the notes you have,
let the user pick one, gather the notes linked to that, let the user
pick one, ..., if the user picks the same note twice, it means the
user really wanted that: so open it.
</p>

<p>
There is a bit of noise in there due to translating file paths to note
links, but roughly that's it. Note that if you are in a note and call
the function with the <code>C-u</code> universal prefix, it reduces the initial
scope to the links of the open note. That is useful if you want to
skip a step when you know what you are looking for.
</p>

<p>
I thought about making something fancier than this, but then I
thought: why bother? It works and I am the only user for now. Let me
know if this gives problems to you.

<p>
<b>Update for V2</b>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/org_roam_v2/">Org Roam changed recently</a>, so the above does not work for V2.
This is the updated function:
</p>

  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((depth (if (numberp arg) arg 1))

          (or choices
              (when arg
                (-map #'org-roam-backlink-target-node (org-roam-backlinks-get (org-roam-node-from-id (or (ignore-errors (org-roam-node-id node))

         (all-notes (org-roam-node--completions))

                              '(metadata

                                                                  (get-text-property 0 'node title))))
                                (category . org-roam-node))
                            (complete-with-action action nodes string pred))))))
            (or (cdr (assoc node nodes))
                (org-roam-node-create :title node)))
          )
         )
    (if (equal node next-node)
        (org-roam-node-visit node)
      (my/navigate-note nil next-node (cons next-node (-map #'org-roam-backlink-source-node (org-roam-backlinks-get next-node)))))))
