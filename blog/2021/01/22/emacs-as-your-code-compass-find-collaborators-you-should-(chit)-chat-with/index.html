<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: find collaborators you should (chit) chat with</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org9b36304" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9b36304">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9b36304">
<p>
Have you ever strongly desired to have a chat about the design of your
code but did not know who to pick? Find who running
<code>c/show-code-communication</code> with your <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org762ac9f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org762ac9f">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org762ac9f">
<p>
Once in a while I have to jump in a code base, do my work, and finally
walk away leaving things better off. I would probably be like Mr. Wolf
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a>, if only it were a movie. Instead, particularly when I
have no clue, my job requires asking around. That easily becomes a
proper investigation when the developer, who Git blamed, is away. How
am I going to find another person now? And how without disturbing my
busy colleagues?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9794b06" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9794b06">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9794b06">
<p>
Apart of my exploratory problem, it would be cool to see clusters of
collaborations for the code base we are working on. I am thinking of
the code base telling me: "you changed this module recently, your
colleague touched this same module, mmm... shall you two have a chat
to see if you are still on the same page?" Probably this is easily
achievable for two close collaborators, but what about <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/18/emacs-as-your-code-compass-finding-code-hotspots/">hotspots</a> which
more than one team changes often? It would be nice to have the
repository history suggest who should have a design chat together to
keep things organized.
</p>

<p>
And even if you are just looking for a bit of gossip: you may want to
discover who communicates/works more often with who. Just to get an
idea!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org55c32a8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org55c32a8">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org55c32a8">
<p>
We can, indeed, learn who we should chat with from our software
history! Any time we work on the same code in the repository, Git
records it. Then we can just count how often that happens over the
repository. If it happens a lot, we shall get notified to discuss
together about the design of this repository (if we are not already
doing it).
</p>

<p>
So let's reuse our fancy edge bundling graph that we saw earlier for
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/01/07/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-related-are-these-modules/">change coupling</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you run <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>'s <code>c/show-code-communication</code> on the <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad">XMonad</a>
repository for the last 2 months, you will see this:

</p>
</div>

<p>
I put my cursor on the <i>slotThe</i> to see the connections this user has
with the others. You can see that the user <i>slotThe</i> has worked on the
same code of the other three users. Since this is a project on GitHub
these people may never have actually spoken together face to face,
still their work intersects.
</p>

<p>
So, say I am editing a piece of code that <i>slotThe</i> edited last time:
if I am really scratching my head, I can try to ping any of those
other authors to see if they can help me out.
</p>

<p>
All in all, this is an analysis that gives you a bit of context of the
relationship between authors.
</p>

<p>
By the way, I find the colors of the links insignificant. The
important information is in the relationships.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org18b7ae6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org18b7ae6">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18b7ae6">
<p>
So just try to see if you find any unexpected communication between
your collaborators! You are just a <code>c/show-code-communication</code> away
from seeing the relationship in the history of your project.
</p>

<p>
Happy communication!
