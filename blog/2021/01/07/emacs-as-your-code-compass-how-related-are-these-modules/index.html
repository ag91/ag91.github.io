<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: how related are these modules?</h1>

Emacs can show us how files are historically related to each other,
just use <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> <code>c/show-coupling-graph</code>. In this post I explain how
that helps you.

<h2 id="org798aadc">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org798aadc">
<p>
When I am maintaining a code base that is not mine, I always wonder:
what would the writer of this code do in my place to extend it. So it
turns out that after some head scratching and reading around, I resort
to act. I add my test, the old tests pass, the pipeline is green.
Everything seems fine, until... crash! The infamous end to end tests
are not flaky this time: my modification broke one. I found the error,
fix it, redeploy: pheeew, all is well what ends well. Then a moment of
curiosity: let me check via <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">magit</a> if anybody else touched the same
files lately. Aaargh! Exactly the same change I did a few weeks ago.
And I spent 3 hours because I broke the end to end tests. If only I
could see this extra file needed a change too!!!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8d961d4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8d961d4">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8d961d4">
<p>
Well, apart of learning from our ancestor maintainers, there is
another reason for which visualizing the relationship between files
over time. That is coupling of irrelevant modules. When two distinct
files need always to change together for a reason, something is wrong
with the design. Most likely there is some functionality that you can
extract from both towards a new module. Discovering and acting on this
design coupling will make you shine with your closer software
architects (you need to show them though, because they are busy
people), and more importantly will save you from the kind of forgetful
behavior I wrote earlier. It is normal for new maintainers to be
unaware of these hidden relations, and it is really a challenge that
makes little sense: let's be tidy and just put things in their right
place!

<h2 id="org73add02">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org73add02">
<p>
So let's skim through the theory once more. Git knows. Code under
version control has another dimension you can access: time. A bit of
Git-foo can already tell you a lot of how files have changed together
during the life of the repository. Why is this information unused by
our editors? Amazing question, let's fix the most adaptable editor
ever to give the example!
</p>

<p>
Actually let me show you what we can do:
</p>

<p>
<a href="/assets/blog/2021/01/07/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-related-are-these-modules/coupling.mp4">/assets/blog/2021/01/07/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-related-are-these-modules/coupling.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
The hedge bundling graph is showing you all the files of the
repository.
</p>


<div id="org010f475" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/01/07/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-related-are-these-modules/hedge-bundling.jpg" alt="hedge-bundling.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The links show you that files have a temporal relationship: when one
changed the other file changed too. The denser the line the more often
it changed together. The color of the lines indicate which changed
before the other, and I did not find a use for that yet. You will
notice that often the coupled files are a module and its test: we
expect that.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting use case of this is learning about the code base:
this graph relationships helps grouping modules by their meaning. For
example the main cluster of relationships in the <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a>'s graph
represent groups of test files that are likely used to test file
conversion from one format to the other. I use this graph myself to
complement the structure of a repositories (I mean the directory tree)
with the structure of the changes over the repository.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I do with this graph, or better the information
underneath is: to let Emacs find the files I should change next! I
shall show you in my next post how a mix of projectile and
code-compass can lighten the way forward.

<h2 id="org5bb82ed">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5bb82ed">
<p>
So the hunt is open! Grab your <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a>, run
<code>c/show-coupling-graph</code> over your favourite repository, and let your
editor finally do more than showing you a flat file with annotations!
What are you going to discover? Please make the best you can out of
this analysis: you really can maintain your repository more
effectively now.

<p>
Happy decoupling!
in your code.
