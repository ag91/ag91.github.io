<h1>Emacs as your code-compass: let history show you which files to edit next</h1>

Emacs can suggest you what file to modify next according to your
repository history. Just get <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> run <code>c/find-coupled-files</code>
on a file in your Git repository!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org903f4c6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org903f4c6">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org903f4c6">
<p>
In <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/01/07/emacs-as-your-code-compass-how-related-are-these-modules/">a previous post</a> I have shown how we can look at modules relations
via a graph. The idea was to find more easily modules that need to
change together and to give you visibility on modules that should be
independent but that are still coupled according to historical change
patterns.
</p>

<p>
Now, a graph is useful as an overview, but what about while we are
coding? As I was saying in my previous post, sometimes I forget to
change some important file causing myself rework and delivery delays.
The terrible thing is that my repository history can tell me what to
do! How nice would it be if Emacs could directly tell me what to
change next?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org92f1098" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org92f1098">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org92f1098">
<p>
There is <a href="https://www.kite.com/">some</a> <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/">momentum</a> for text editors to become smarter and make
life easier for the developer. Ideally, as Gregory T. Brown explores
in the last chapter of his book <a href="file:///home/andrea/workspace/agenda/notes/20200726202344-programming_beyond_practice.html">Programming beyond practice</a>, we should
replace low-level tools with more advanced tools which make us feel
closer to our work: imagine focusing only on understanding your
clients problems, and then in a few knowledgeable inputs shave off the
rough solution of our computer to fit our client requirements
perfectly. Instead we get side tracked by that recursion that is
overflowing our stack <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
This is still a bit far away as far as I know. It would be cool,
though, if we could move Emacs a step closer to that side of things.
At least, let's make it learn from our Git history!
</p>

<h2 id="orgef58f5b">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgef58f5b">
<p>
Until we get to the point where our <del>computer</del> Emacs does most of the
plumbing work for us, let's integrate the data of that fancy graph I
showed you earlier into our <code>find-file</code>!
</p>

<p>
This is how code-compass latest feature looks like:

</video>

<p>
  In the above we generate a cache that stores for each project you
  visit a list of coupled files. When the cache is ready we can use
  <code>c/find-coupled-files</code>. If the file has no significant history, a
  message lets us know that no file was found. Otherwise, it provides a
  list of coupled files sorted by amount of changes and relevance: so
  the first proposed file is surely what you want to change next.
</p>

<p>
  (Now that I think of it, I should probably introduce an optional
  toggle that if on discards files if you have already changed them: in
  that way you could use this choice as a todo list for your change.)
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, I surely cannot remember to produce the cache while I am
  working on something. For that reason, I set a hook appositely for
  that in my configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
  <pre class="src src-elisp">(run-with-timer 10 nil (lambda () (add-hook 'projectile-find-file-hook 'c/get-coupled-files-alist-hook-fn)))
  </pre>
</div>

<p>
  I use <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">projectile</a>, and I thought that the best moment for me to create
  the cache is when I open a new file through projectile. Due to some
  initialization error, I delay the setting of that hook in my
  configuration: I run a timer to set the hook after 10 seconds Emacs
  initialized.
</p>

<p>
  On the long run I plan to focus my code-compass work more towards this
  direction, because I think the repository history can give us much
  more value than this. I am still experimenting and designing things,
  but hopefully this gives you a taste of what is coming.
</p>

  <h2 id="org1e18fcd">Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1e18fcd">
    <p>
      So get <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> and let it help you finding out which files is
      best to change after the one at hand! You just need to run
      <code>c/find-coupled-files</code> on a file in the current project, and set a
      hook if you do not want to wait.
    </p>

      Happy coding!
