Do you want to see how knowledge is distributed in your repository?
Use code-compass <code>c/show-knowledge-graph</code> to see an interactive
knowledge map!

<h2 id="org2c6f09e">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c6f09e">
<p>
It is nice to know who to ask for help. One thing that is worth
learning in life is to ask. A lot of us come to dislike asking because
expresses needing something and makes us look vulnerable. Even if that
were true, vulnerability has got a lot of good traits: for once it
sets strong foundations for human relations like friendship <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. When I am
working, <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/10/23/challenge-problems-effectively-how-to-know-when-to-stop-doing-it-alone-and-ask-for-help/">asking is fundamental</a>. It is efficient because you may save
time in solving a problem if somebody experienced it before AND, more
importantly, you get in touch with somebody! The more people you know
at work the better.
</p>

<p>
So which people <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/emacs-as-your-code-compass-find-collaborators-you-should-(chit)-chat-with">should you chat with</a> if you are working on a certain
part of the repository? And if you have a problem in understanding the
whole repository (and do not wish to go through your Git logs manually
to find a contributor)? Could we visualize if there is a major
contributor for this repository who can help us?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcbdc6c7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcbdc6c7">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcbdc6c7">
<p>
Apart of knowing who to ask for help, there is another interesting use
case for having a view of how knowledge is spread in the code base. It
may happen during your career to be working on a project and suddenly
discovering that the main contributor has decided to move on in a few
weeks. You congratulate them, give them your best wishes, and then in
a moment of quiet you realize: "Wait, if they go I am the next main
contributor!!!". This is the part where you shiver because you know
you miss some project knowledge but it is unclear what exactly. This
is something that happened to me, and it is such a basic error to let
your pal leave without asking the right questions! It always happen
that you discover what you needed to ask just the day after they have
left!
</p>

<p>
What if instead we had hints of what knowledge we would miss if they
left?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d20cd7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2d20cd7">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2d20cd7">
<p>
Naturally <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> can help you with that! Let's see how
code-compass's knowledge is distributed at the moment:
</p>


<div id="orgc7c854f" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/01/28/emacs-as-your-code-compass-who-can-i-ask-for-help/code-compass-knowledge.jpg" alt="code-compass-knowledge.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I am enthusiastic to see somebody other than me popping up in the
knowledge map for code-compass! Indeed, recently Blank Spruce has
contributed to the project by moving out HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
Python code that I had embedded in the main Elisp file. Much cleaner!
</p>

<p>
You can see in the image that there is a legend on the right that you
can scroll. The black big dot is a file (README.org) that <a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a> cannot
recognize as a source file and so the graph leaves it marked as
unknown. You can see from the knowledge map that I have copied @Blank
Spruce for the latest analyses, and if you cannot see it clearly let
me show you:

</video>
</p>


<p>
  Another detail you may pick up now is that, if you move your pointer
  over the name of the module, the text changes to indicate who is the
  main contributor of that file <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Once you associate the color to the
  person, you can easily see how the knowledge is distributed.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at another code base to get a better idea of how to use
this for a bigger project:
</p>


<div id="org4915c98" class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2021/01/28/emacs-as-your-code-compass-who-can-i-ask-for-help/xmonad.jpg" alt="xmonad.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is the knowledge map for <a href="">xmonad</a>. Who do you think is the
maintainer of this project? Naturally, Adam Vogt! You can see it at
once from how orange is the repository. So that would be the best
person to ask for help if you have a conceptual question about the
project. And if Adam plans to leave the project at any point, well...
you may need more than the notice period to ask enough questions!
</p>

<p>
A note: the colors available by default are limited because the
projects I work on usually have a decent amount of contributors, but
not too many. You can change that though if you need more or just do
not like my choice. For that you can provide a list of colors in
<code>c/authors-colors</code> (I got some of them from <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/color/named_colors.html">here</a> because a Python
script was handling them).

<h2 id="orge9a9142">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9a9142">
<p>
So, curious who to ask for help? Grab <a href="https://github.com/ag91/code-compass">code-compass</a> and you are a
<code>c/show-knowledge-graph</code> away from seeing how the knowledge is
distributed and who to ask help to.
</p>

<p>
Happy asking!
