Do you want to be a writer? Be a writer every day! Set a goal on the
number of words you want to write and DO IT. If you need support with
that, try <a href="https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals">writer-word-goals</a>.

<h2 id="org39fe4aa">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org39fe4aa">
<p>
I like to write. It is something that I enjoy. It also allows my
thoughts to reach more people that I could ever meet in person. Most
of my writing effort goes into making what I think as clear as
possible to my readers. This because I try to share things that are
beneficial to them. Naturally I test these on myself first.
</p>

<p>
One thing that bugs me as a writer is my lack of consistency. I
typically write when I like it. I keep track of a list of topics I
want to write about, but I have always kept the when and how
malleable.
</p>

<p>
Lately I have been wondering if this is a smart thing to (not) do.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4397f95" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4397f95">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4397f95">
<p>
In general you can find cases of geniuses that can run a marathon or
produce an incredible work of art without practice. Well, from a range
of activities that I do (from bread making to writing) I carefully
tested that I am outside that small set of people. So as any other
common mortal I need to <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/05/02/fail-fast-and-then-fail-better/">try, fail and fail better</a>. The problem is that
I need to do it a lot of times to really catch up with the geniuses
(and overcome them if they keep skipping practice)! And the only
better tool than quantity that I am aware of is constancy.
</p>

<p>
And I asked myself: can my editor help me with that?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org209aa36" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org209aa36">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org209aa36">
<p>
I had these ideas lurking in my head from some weeks when I started
taking <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/walter-mosley-teaches-fiction-and-storytelling">this course by Walter Mosley</a>. This person is inspiring. What
touched me is that he decided to become a writer because in the eyes
of his society he was already a failure. Then he managed to get there
by his grit.
</p>

<p>
Even watching just the little sample of the class you get his pearl:
write every day and, before writing, edit the work of the previous
day. Then just keep going. Forever. Likely, you will become a
professional writer because of compounding. He also suggests the
amount of words: one thousands word per day.
</p>

<p>
This resonated with <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/09/12/slow-growth-insomnia-and-curing-symptoms/">my</a> <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/09/26/life-is-short-but-not-short-enough-to-skip-planning/">beliefs</a> <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/01/07/cycle-everything-why-waste-does-not-exist/">in</a> <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/12/12/life-is-a-cycle-why-periodic-behaviour-is-good-for-your-health/">habits</a>. Assuming that you have a way
to tell yourself to do something everyday, I can show you how to
customize Emacs to be your coach while you are running towards
completing your thousand words mini-marathon.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a few lines of Elisp to change Emacs in your writing coach:
you tell your editor your goal for the current buffer, and Emacs will
quietly ping you every quarter of a minute with encouragement for your
progress until you are in the buffer.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind this is to make our writing process a bit of a game: I
want to see that I am succeeding towards my writing goal while I am
doing it.
</p>

<p>
I initially thought to show a progress bar <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, but then I thought: worse is
better <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>! While I am writing
this, Emacs has just printed a message <code>Okay! 328 words left.</code> which
tells me that I am rather close to my goal. I am going to edit this
blog, so I may end up cutting or/and adding some content, but as a
first go I find it supporting to see the count going down. It just
makes me feel good and enjoy the writing session even more.
</p>

<p>
You can try my mode by just downloading (or copying) the code from
<a href="https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals">https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals</a>.
</p>

<p>
This little mode is so simple that the only customization I left to
the user is <code>wwg/monitor-period</code>. This defines how often Emacs
notifies you about progress. I tuned this to 15 seconds according to
my tastes. Potentially you can also customize the logic of the counter
by modifying <code>wwg/monitor-function</code>, for example to make it fitter to
the kind of file you are editing. I write in plain text formats, so
keywords do not bias the word count. If you are editing LaTex files or
similar, where keywords are everywhere, the bias can be significant.
Then you may really want to provide a more sophisticated value for
<code>wwg/monitor-function</code>.
</p>

<p>
The only curious feature of this mode is that Emacs becomes silent if
you move to another buffer. Maybe you got caught in something urgent
and you will likely dislike it, if your minibuffer is getting polluted
unnecessarily. Hence, I have fleshed out a bit of buffer management so
that if you wish to run multiple goals at the same time for the
current Emacs session, you are free to challenge yourself.

<h2 id="org8c737a5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8c737a5">
<p>
Are you or do you wish to be a writer then? No matter how good you
are, some practice is necessary. And the more you are consistent the
more incredible will be your progress. If you want a bit of support in
your endeavour, grab my <a href="https://github.com/ag91/writer-word-goals">writer-word-goals</a> and run
<code>wwg/set-goal-current-buffer</code> to set your own goal. Or follow Walter
Mosley's advice and just run <code>wwg/set-1k-goal-current-buffer</code>, which
will set your goal to one thousand words.
</p>

<p>
Happy writing!
