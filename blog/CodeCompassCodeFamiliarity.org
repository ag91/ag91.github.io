What part of the codebase are you (or some of your coworker)
unfamiliar with? Can Emacs tell you?

With [[https://github.com/ag91/code-compass][code-compass]] this is super easy. I have just modified slightly
[[https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/01/28/emacs-as-your-code-compass-who-can-i-ask-for-help/][the knowledge analysis]] to support this use case. Now it also asks you
about a set of contributors to filter the analysis upon.

Here how it looks:

Happy familiarizing!
