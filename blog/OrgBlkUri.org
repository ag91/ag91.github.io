The other day I had an enjoyable [[https://github.com/ag91/emacs-buddy][EmacsBuddy]] videocall and, on the
topic of "how do you use Org Mode", I showed without thinking how I
capture file and web contents in my Org Mode files.

I usually use this to capture web pages that may be taken down (for
example, job ads).

I then discovered that this feature could be of use also to others! So
this afternoon I managed to release [[https://github.com/ag91/org-blk-uri][org-blk-uri]], a tiny library on top
of [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-web-tools][org-web-tools]].

This is a GIF of what it does:

Hope that may help you too!
