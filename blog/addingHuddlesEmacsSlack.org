After some researching I found out that starting a Slack huddle (a
call within the Slack app) is super easy: just open a link in the
browser with room and team id.

So I decided to [[https://github.com/ag91/emacs-slack/commit/1202ba72e7fa76d04741b00f8d69c4e9c58ff1ee][add the functionality]] to my fork of emacs-slack.

Now if you are in a slack buffer (you can test it freely, the app will
ask you for confirmation before starting/joining a call), you can just
do =M-x slack-join-huddle=.

This along with fixing the threads suddenly closing while I was typing
is making emacs-slack a nice experience for me.

Happy slacking!
