#+DESCRIPTION: Just an announcement that I made a repo to keep track of Emacs buddies available to help

So, this is just a mini announcement and a little of a status report
about the Emacs Buddy initiative.

The announcement:

I have created a repository to add people that wish to be buddies to
other Emacs users

https://github.com/ag91/emacs-buddy

The status report:

three people got in touch so far and they are all very nice! We
exchanged just a few mails and I think I know a thing or two to help
them help themselves. And it was a great surprise that Justin got in
touch to offer himself as a buddy! That is the reason why I made the
repository in the weekend: I didn't prepare for that. A great surprise
indeed!
